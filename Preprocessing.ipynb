It is therefore interesting to convert them into their original form in order for a word to be counted only once.\n\nEg: giving, gave and given all have the same root: \"give\". It is not necessary for our analysis to catalog all of those forms. Instead of gathering each of them seperatly, this step will transform and gather them all into the form \"give\" to falicitate the analysis.\n\nOne of the method used here is **Stemming** which cuts the last letters of a word until the stem is reached. This method is rather effective on most english words. However, the end word may not make sens.\nExample of stemming:\n- boater, boating, boats --> boat\n- service --> servic\nHere, we are using PorterStemmer for the stemming (https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/)\n\nWe are also using **Lemmatisation** as in contrast to stemming, lemmatization looks beyond word reduction and considers a language’s full vocabulary to apply a morphological analysis to words. Exemple:\n- was, been, am --> be\n- mice --> mouse\n\nThe reason why we are using both methods is because lemmatiers require a lot more knowledge about structure of a language than stemming. Therefore, the result will often result to the same inputed word because the algorithm didn't suceed in finding the root of the word",
