"EDGAR","Great projector","Great item, worth every penny. I was skeptical about it after seeing comments on how loud the fan is. In all actually I barely hear it when the volume is low, but it does an amazing job in cooling the projector. Every time the capsule is cool after running over 3 hours. Highly recommended, the picture below is on a stucco exterior wall but the image still looks amazing.",5,
"Jesse","A little projector that packs a punch!","Bought this for my wife for her birthday. She wanted a projector in the bedroom to cast upon the ceiling. I was all over getting this for her! After doing research and looking at a lot of different mini projectors, nothing even came close to the awesomeness that this thing portrayed. When it arrived and we got it all hooked up and running, we weren't disappointed in the slightest. We purchased the tripod stand with it and it does exactly what we wanted it to do.While the ceiling isn't the best projection surface (it's a textured ceiling), it still worked great. We have since moved it to project across our wall and boy does it take up the whole dang thing! Of course, you're not going to get be getting 1080p quality with a device this small and compact, but it's still more than watchable. We quickly installed Plex and Netflix, added the remote control app to our phones, and were watching shows and controlling this bad boy in no time flat. The fact that it houses the apps on the device itself is super convenient. I've been thoroughly impressed with the Nebula Capsule and look forward to trying it in different settings (camping anyone?). It makes me want to check out Anker's other projector offerings to see the differences between them. Well done, Anker, hopefully, you'll keep improving and putting out awesome products. You have a fan.Pros -* The product is extremely well built and doesn't feel cheap at all* Came packaged wonderfully and was a breeze to setup and get going* For the size, I don't feel you will find a better projector with as many features* The picture quality is surprisingly awesome, even when it spans a large space* The remote control app works great and was easy to install and pair with the device* The sound is quite good from something so petite. Haven't had any problems hearing our showsCons -* I really don't have anything negative to say at this point in time. From a device so small, you really can't expect to have the brightest projection or highest pixel density, so no need to gripe about it. We're happy :) If we discover anything that we feel deserves to go in the column, it will be added post-haste!",5,
"Brian","Well thought-out, high-quality","Every time I use this projector, I like it more. The build quality feels really solid, the picture quality is better than I expected, if a little low on contrast, and the sound quality is good. At first I was hesitant to download yet another app to my phone just for controlling it, since the included remote control works well. But I will admit that once I caved and downloaded the remote control app, it's well-designed and very functional. I've also used AirPlay to mirror my screen to the Nebula, to watch video from a different app, and that worked seamlessly. So far the 4-hour playback time has been pretty accurate and reliable, which is great because it is so highly portable. I've been slipping it in my camera bag in place of an extra lens, which makes it so easy to bring along anywhere. And, you can run it off of an external USB battery to extend the runtime if you really want to binge Netflix. All in all, I expect to be using this for years to come!",5,
"SSG Cross","Truly amazing piece of hardware. I'm blown away!","First the not so great: Initially it is kind of a pain to set up, but after that it's great! For some reason it was having trouble connecting to Netflix at first, but once it connected it was good to go and didn't disconnect at all while watching a movie. So perhaps it was just having issue initially. If it's a consistent issue I will post and update and perhaps rethink my rating but right now I'm having no problems with it anymore and it works fantastic. Also if you are getting this device I would advise you to go into settings and update it right away that might also fix any issues you might have with the device. Setting up Netflix and signing in with your account takes a little patience but it's worth it, and once it's done your don't have to do it again. For the price I was kind of hoping it would come with a HDMI cable but that's ok I just went and bought one real quick. So if you don't have a spare lying around I would order one with this. Once you get used to the Console Control App, it is actually a lot of fun to use.Ok, now that the nitpicking is over I can get into the device more thoroughly. The speaker is really great. It's not super loud, but it's loud enough that everything is very clear. The screen also gives a GREAT picture. If there's some light out, the dark scenes in the movie or show you are watching is going to be a little hard to make out, but once the lights go out the picture is magnificent. I really am VERY impressed with the picture. There is also a knob on the side to adjust the focus depending on your distance. The device is surprisingly quiet, and it stays VERY cool. That was also surprising because I expected it to get pretty hot considering it is a projector. All around I am VERY pleased with this product and I'm so glad that this was my first choice in a projector. I've always wanted one, but they were always too bulky, and tend to be loud. This thing is just incredible.I'm amazed every day at the leaps and bounds technology is taking and I'm excited to see what comes out next as the decades go by.",5,
"chris","Awesome little projector","Awesome little projector! Google and Hulu doesn’t work when you get it because it wants you to use google plus but I found a way to fix that! Go into settings then about and click on android version 5 times and a box will pop up asking for a password. Enter gmstest1222 as the password. It will download and do its thing then reboot and bam! You have google play and now Hulu and everything works for me. Don’t know how long the password is good for but as of now it worked for me.",5,
"John","Amazing.  Perfect if you have a baby in a crib like I do.","This thing is epic.  I recommend it to everyone.  I just had a baby and I purchased this, along with a mini tripod, and it has saved my life.  I project cartoons onto the ceiling and the baby loves it.  It is bright enough to be useful.  The picture quality is also passable.  This isn't a 2400lumen Epson home theater but for what it is, and the price, it is great.  The speaker is more than loud enough for a living room although I would go with the Epson if you were looking for a home theater.  This is perfect for entertaining guests outside or doing a powerpoint presentation.  Heck, this would go perfectly in a bedroom if you are not looking to run cables, make holes, and go through a hassle.  There is a 300 lumen version, I am not sure about how it works but, if this is something you are looking to have permanently in a bright room, I would look into that.",5,
"Mr. Truth","Awesome. Simple to use.","Great projector. Works right out of the box. It only took two minutes to set up. Simple to use on your phone if you download the app. You do not even need the included remote.  You can project this on almost any surface and have a great picture.  It puts out amazing sound for such a small device. Don’t be fooled by reviews saying the software is too complicated.  There is nothing to it- I installed Netflix, Hulu, etc within minutes. You login to them with your regular user info and you are up and running in no time.",5,
"Charles","Take note, adding a USB-C to HDMI for mobile devices, lighting cord iPhone will???","Some devices are forbidden to project copyrighted images to a device like the Capsule, but a USB- C, or lighting adapter for HDMI, works well. I bought it for camping trips, take note to buy a power bank with this device. I bought a Blackweb power brick to watch movies, and tv off my mobile phone all night camping. Great when your watching the morning news in a tent, eating breakfast, checking on the stock market, and the other campers just ehhh, CAN'T, heh.",5,
"dmr","Works as advertised.","I went through 3 projectors brands before I landed on this and everything worked. Easy setup! Everything works on my iPhone I can’t get it to work on my iPad for some reason. But portable & great! It’ll eat some juice even while plugged into a power source. And it does not charge quickly. And once it disconnects from the slideshow it just keeps doing it. Odd since it stays connected to WiFi. But I love this item. And I’m still happy w/ it.",5,
"Doc","Really frickin' cool","Pretty amazing little device...  used camping in the deep wilderness.  The little thing is bright enough to make a Lycra screen about 12 feet on the horizontal look as bright as a movie theatre when really dark outside.  Great sounds.  Played two movies before it quit.  You can re-charge off a battery pack as well which is a huge bonus.  Good enough that if i ever moved,  might sell my real TV and just use this.",5,
"YJS","The Amazing Little Projector","Great picture and sound from such a small device! It really is the size of a soda can. I love the portability; I can watch anywhere in and out of the house. I tried it on my bedroom wall, maximum size and the picture quality is still great.I downloaded the phone app, because you can use your phone like a remote and personally i find it easier that way. So far Netflix, Prime video, and youtube all works well without a glitch.My dog is mesmerized by the moving images on the wall and the shiny light. Also likes to walk in front of the device, but it’s OK i like to watch canine silhouette show too.",5,
"PhilD","Everything they say it can do, it does, and does it well","I love this projector, it now goes on all my trips, the only minor problem is that the focus dial is way too sensitive, if it could have more travel that would be great.The display is great on most light surfaces, it works well sat at the bottom of the bed onto the ceiling.Obviousley, it needs darkness to be really good,but when its dark its great.The speaker is fantastic, who knew so much sound with great quality could come from this?",5,
"Kaci McCoy","It does what it do","Small, bright, and clear, with a decent speaker. I spent weeks checking reviews of portable projectors to use in lieu of a TV and during travel, ultimately deciding to go with this projector. It has delivered! We have used this indoors and out - the picture quality suffers a bit without a smooth surface or dark room, but not enough to dampen the experience. The speaker is surprisingly clear, although it may be a little quiet if there is background noise. One point to note: you must use the company’s app to play videos (log in to YouTube, Amazon, Netflix, etc.) rather than screen mirroring or casting from each individual app.",5,
"Jenni Haines","Best invention ever!!","We have used this on vacations, and most recently we stayed a few days with the kids in Vegas. After a long day of sightseeing, my husband set up the projector to show on the ceiling right above the children’s bed. Lol! We have a very nice full sized projector in our home. The picture quality in this nebula is just as clear!! We have been blown away with this product. Amazing!!",5,
"I'm a wolf rider, I'm free","The Bomb-Diggity","I am so impressed with this little projector. It was easy to set up and use and the picture quality and sound were great! I had it about 4 feet from the wall in a moderately lit room and we could see just fine. The remote was super easy to use. I have used it for watching videos and giving presentations  and it's perfect.",5,
"I HSUAN YEH","Best smart projector I’ve owned","Having owned other projectors, the quality of the Nebula Capsule honestly matches that of high-end projectors that cost in the thousands. And yet it’s a fraction of the size, is far more silent, and does not overheat to an absurd, untouchable temperature. It comes pre-loaded with works: Netflix, YouTube etc. The remote is intuitive and simple, and the remote smart phone app is genius.Needless to say, you get a lot of bang for your buck.",5,
"Sam.  T","Convenient","I enjoy using this projector.  I use it outside indoors for pleasure and business. Not as bright as electric projectors but well worth the convenience. Selling point for me was the 4-hour battery. I haven’t used it for a straight 4- hour projection, but I have used it for about 4 hours without charging over a couple of days.",5,
"Momoffour","Great customer service, great projector!","I feel compelled to rewrite our review.  Our first review we left only 2 starts due to a charging issue that started after a few uses.  I did not contact customer service because I assumed we had owned the device for too long (8 months) to do anything about our problem.  However, shortly after leaving the initial review, customer service contacted us and promptly replaced our device and sent us a a travel case for our trouble.  Anker stands behind their products!  The Nebula Capsule is small and does a great job.  We use it in our house on a screen but it  also worked great this summer outside on the side of our house.  Sound great, easy sharpening and connects to everything we have tried.",5,
"Luke Stamps","Best projector ever!","Excellent quality! The picture is even better in real life! Talk about being able to go to the bathroom and keep watching tv! Plus get the shower beer holder, watch TV in the shower!!! Party on Wayne!",5,
"David Yu","So happy with my purchase","I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she initially wanted to return it but thankfully she gave it a try first.  We don’t have a television in our bedroom or master bath so having this projector gives us the flexibility to watch things while in bed or lounging in the tub.  So happy with that aspect.  Then, I had to contact customer support for an issue I had and they were quick to respond (within 24 hours) and resolved my issue.  Would highly recommend the Capsule as a product and Nebula as a company!",5,
"FavoriteRN","Small device....packs a big punch!","I bought this off Amazon’s Travel Trunk. I’ve never heard or saw a projector so small, so stylish, project a great sound or picture. We have stopped using our TV for movie night because this item gives a more theater feel at night.",5,
"Ashley","It’s more like a portable smart tv 📺","I have stopped using my tv since I bought this thing. It’s self contained and I can download movies onto it! I even take it with me for long 🛁 baths. Way better than my iPad.A note- the upgrade button on the homepage is for updates, not an add.",5,
"Stacy Iler","As advertised","Pretty much exactly what I thought it was gonna be like. Sound and picture was great. Nice that you can control it with your phone or the remote control. I recommend buying a tripod to be able to put it anywhere while you watch movies and stuff",5,
"Amanda S.","Exactly what I was looking for!","Love it. Exactly what I was looking for and also so small. This was a replacement for a different one I had and am happy with all the options for hookup. I use it for work and also to project movies on the garage. Multipurpose.",5,
"Conner Harkness","A Theater in a Can Without Cables!","I can't even begin to describe how awesome it is to have a theater in my pocket built with quality in mind from a reputable brand. Like everyone is saying, the color is amazing. The device runs Android 7.1.2, and if you know how to side-load APKs, you can install apps like Google Chrome, RetroArch, and Kodi. I'm a fair bit disappointed that it doesn't come with Google Play Services and that I can't change the homescreen app, but Anker, if you're reading this, I want to help make that happen!",5,
"N.Reynolds","Picture and sound quality is great","I was surprised the picture and sound quality would be so good coming from something so small. Perfect gift for my husband with a great price.",5,
"Des","I'll never buy another TV","Was upset that when I bought this it wouldn't allow me to watch Netflix, but thanks to a previous review and some digging speaking with Rion from anker helped me out a lot. He literally helped me in 3 minutes. I'm very pleased with the customer service from Anker, and I love the Capsule.",5,

"Vincent E Freda","Great little projector. Even better customer service!","This little projector allows me to view all my streaming apps...on the ceiling! I’m very impressed with the picture and sound quality given how small a device this is. I was able to flawlessly use Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube directly from the Nebula Capsule. What I’m most impressed about is Anker’s customer service. I had a few questions and within minutes, a representative got back to me and answered all of my questions. Overall, I’m very pleased.",5,
"patrick","Amazing product","I've been using at remote places to show my documentaries, villages and etc.. it's a great product, very protable and good quality.",5,

You can also stream your screen to the device using AirPlay or use the device as a bluetooth speaker. The hardware IR remote feels nice in hand but there's also a free bluetooth remote control app on the App Store. The automatic keystone correction is the coolest feature of this device -- tilt the Nebula up slightly and the shape of the projection will look like a trapezoid. Then the device realizes the projection is askew and automatically adjusts the shape of the projection to a rectangle again!",5,

"Dave_H","Simply Awesome! Just love this product","Simply Awesome! Just love this product. I purchased it from their campaign on Indiegogo along with the carry case and stand.Pros:1. UI interface is great using aptoide apk to download apps (although not as good as Android Play store) but still has most of the apps.2. Settings has 4 different options to project the screen and also has an option to clean cached data which is great.3. Sound quality of the speakers is awesome4. Really portable and battery life is good. (runs around 2.5 - 3 hrs on full charge. You can also keep it connected to power source and keep it running)5. Haven't fully tested their app from play store but so far no issues.Cons:1. Works okay in well lit condition. You need the room to be slightly dark in order to have a good viewing experience.2. No usb-c support but not a deal breaker for me as I use other dongles.3. I heard a lot of people complaining about the 480 resolution. I personally did not have any issues with the quality of videos I watched on youtube, netflix etc.4. The top buttons (layer) of the projector is made of plastic. Overall the build quality is great but if the can make the top layer have a more rubbery feel (like the provided remote), it would be great.All in all a wonderful product. Just a suggestion if Nebula team can provide 100 inch screens as an add-on along with carry case and stand then it would be a great combination.",5,
"Mike O","Ok, I have a case of the WOWs... love this portable projector!","One work summary:  WOW!  Great build quality, and Christian from Nebula support was able to help me activate the use of the Google Play Store!  The battery life is great and it is such a convenient product.  So nice not to have to carry a billion things for great portable (and shareable) video!  The image quality is very good, even though it is not 1080p... very acceptable picture quality.  In a dark environment, the picture is downright awesome.  Great not to have to carry extra speakers as well.",5,
"Darby","Amazing Product!","I originally got this product for business. I am in sales an want to be able to project my power point presentations on this. I recently hosted a coaches summit for work in my office and this was used to do just that! There wasn't a conference room available so this worked out perfectly!  We now use it in our house as a portable TV for netflix/hulu. I love it! With any projector the sound can come off a bit muffled but overall I love the capabilities it has and could see myself continuing to invest in the Nebula in the future!",5,

"Maggie","Anker Nebula Capsule is well worth the money!!!!","I have been blown away by the quality of this product. It was well worth the money!I'm going to start with probably the most important aspect, brightness. I have used this projector outside about a half hour before dark and was able to see the picture very well. It was projected on a tan shed and it was still a quality picture. I don't think anyone will have trouble viewing movies with this outside after/or close to dark.The sound is amazing! The only time I wished for a little more volume was camping outside with a TON of cricket/locust noise AND I was probably 8 feet from the projector. The volume is amazing for such a small machine. And the fan noise has NEVER bothered us. My fiance didn't even know there was a fan because he had never heard it run. It may be a little loud if you were real close to the projector, or in a very small room, but its not noticeable outside.Battery life is qonderful! You can easily watch two movies on a full charge, and it takes very little time to recharge.We have only watched Netflix on this device so far so I have not used the remote provided because for some reason it doesn't work with Netflix. This is by no means a deal breaker. The app you download on your phone is extremely easy to use, and gives you more flexibility.I love this projector! It has far exceeded my expectations. I rave to everyone about the quality of my nebula! So glad I chose to spend the extra money and go with this one!",5,

With the help of Adam at Anker I had the google app store up and running in 5 minutes.  Now, this thing is a full functioning android projector!  Go to ABOUT in the settings menu and CLICK ON THE ANDROID VERSION 5 TIMES in a row.  A password window comes up, input a password you must obtain from Anker...... then click DONE and OK.  You will be presented with a new download.  Say yes and download it. After it finishes it will reboot.  When it reboots you will have full google apps including the google play store.  To access the play store go to APP MANAGER on the home menu and you will see the play store and all the other google apps.  This addition made the capsule a truly amazing device!

"T Wang","can sit nicely on most surfaces and also comes with a standard ...","This is a revolutionary product --- a very usable portable projector. It is decently bright; can work for hours on battery; can sit nicely on most surfaces and also comes with a standard tripod screw hole. It comes with Android 7.1, so it works as a portable smart TV on its own. It can also mirror screens of cell phones (I tested both IOS and android) and computers through wifi and bluetooth. Therefore, it has a very convenient and truly wireless setup. There is simply no other non-Anker/Nebula portable projector available today (Jan 2018) in its league.The only projector worthy of comparison is the Nebula Mars. For not too much more money (especially when Mars has a discount), you get 500 ANSI Lumens vs 100, 1280x800 resolution vs 854x480, 19500mAh battery vs 5200mAh, 10W JBL speakers vs 5W unknown speakers. So Mars seems like a better deal. However, I simply cannot get over the portability of Capsule. In my mind, this single factor outweighs all the rest of them. Moreover, Capsule runs Android 7.1 now and probably will get an Android 8 upgrade, while Mars still has Android 4.4.  That is another plus for Capsule. Actually, the two seem to have the same processor, RAM and ROM, so maybe Mars may also have the updated software one day?The Amazon page is missing most of the specs mentioned above. Instead of brightness, battery capacity and resolution, it mentions picture sizes and playtime. But the specs should nevertheless be there.I have been using this device for two days, for projecting my screen when working, and for movies. When projecting 100"" images, it is perfectly bright in a dark room at night, but is very dim during daytime even with the curtains closed. But I can always move it closer to the wall and make the projection smaller. At 30"", the pictures are visible even in a bright room. So in terms of brightness, I would say it is very usable. There are two modes: standard and ""battery"". I assume the latter will make it dimmer. The battery life is amazing. The Amazon description says 4 hours, while the Indiegogo description says 2.5 hours. With the device set to standard mode, I could use it nonstop (steaming videos online) for 4 hours and still have about 30% charge left. It has automatic vertical keystone correction. There is no horizontal ones, but that is normal.  It is suggested to work below a relative humidity of 85%, and does not seem to have any IP ratings, so using it in the bathroom may not be a good idea. To stream media from a USB flash drive, you have to use the provided micro USB male to USB A female cable that is about 2 inches long, like a tail to the device. While the setup does not look nice and the conversion cable is one more thing to carry, it is a pretty logical choice.The device is very well packaged --- better than Apple products, I would say.  It also comes with high-quality accessories, including a travel porch with the same material as those for Anker batteries, an Anker micro USB cable and a nice compact charger with Quick Charge 3.0.",5,2018-01-11 00:00:00.000
"Amb2020","Amazing little device","This will save you a lot of research... I'll address some of the ""pitfalls"" that others have mentioned in their initial reviews first and then will tell you how much I like this device.- Limited App store: I found this to be the case at first, but with help from an awesome Nebula representative named Ashley, there's a very simple workaround and YOU CAN DOWNLOAD MOST APPS.  Go to APKpure.com and download the android app installers to a thumb drive. Then plug the thumb drive into the capsule and install the apps.  It's really simple and I wasn't sketched out by the process (I'm pretty hesitant to download things from unknown sources) and it worked like a charm.  I now have Sling TV, HBO Go, Showtime Anytime, and most of the apps I couldn't download from the native store. Took me about 20 minutes to find, download, and install all of the apps I wanted.- Brightness: it's really pretty impressive.  You have to consider that this thing is the size of a soda can... You don't need the room to be super dark to get a pretty bright picture from about 3-8 feet from the wall.  In a reasonably dark room, you can back up to about 10-11 feet away and get a massive screen, with pretty good clarity and brightness.- Sound: again, consider what this device is.  Its the size of a coke can.  It's not bad.The best thing about this gadget is that its really so portable, and its so easy to just place on a table, turn it on and start watching.  The throw range on this projector is great for how you'll use it-  you will have somewhere between an 80-100 inch screen from the average coffee table.  It's also awesome that it runs android and therefore can house a ton of native apps and you don't have to always lug another device around with the projector.  The battery will easily get you through a movie even if you're also using the speaker.  For movies, I'd say you want to connect to a separate bluetooth speaker.  Final point is that both Anker and Nebula will never really let you down.  The customer service experience is fantastic and they are more than happy to let you beta test new features.UPDATE:After a few weeks of everyday use, I like this thing even more.  All of the features you get for the price make this a great value-- and it's sturdy as hell.  I've already knocked it off my coffee table and it is fine.  I'm projecting onto a white wall about 10 feet from the projector and in dark settings, the screen is roughly 7'x4' and the contrast is pretty decent/pretty good.  The focus wheel is really sensitive, so I find that sometimes I am super impressed by the picture clarity, and sometimes I just can't seem to get it right no matter how hard I try.  That said, it's definitely going to exceed your expectations in terms of overall picture (given its size and price tag) and it is really well built.  Some of the apps I downloaded via my little trick are finicky and don't work sometimes, but sling tv and YouTube Tv work pretty well as well as obviously the native apps like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, etc.  And get a tripod...

"dfa1234","great quality, easy to use & stream from various apps","This projector is awesome! My husband got it for me for Christmas I was nervous because I have a lot of Apple products and I am not used to android but so far it's been super easy to use and compatible with my iphone and airplay and mirroring. I have also hooked my phone up with a hdmi/lightening adapter but don't really notice a difference in quality I think streaming and hardwiring are both great. I set up netflix, youtube, and the dish anywhere app right on the device and stream easily with no issues although I do use the nebula connect app on my phone as a remote for netflix and dish. I think the quality is not much different than my high def 1080p TV. My kids are all obsessed with watching movies on the every wall in our house now , it works well in all of our neutral painted rooms and pretty good on my sons dark blue walls in his room. We also use it in bed on the ceilings. I can't fit a TV anywhere in our kitchen so now i can set it up and project it pretty much anywhere in there. The speakers work well and it goes louder than I expected it to. I plan on buying the stand to go with it since finding somewhere to put it that is the right height all the time is kind of annoying. It is pretty durable too and has survived my 3 and 5 year old playing with it. But I also purchased the assurian warranty too just in case.",5,2019-01-02 00:00:00.000
"Rebecca M","Amazing projector for the price. Tons of fun","We have had the Nebula Capsulefor about two months now and absolutely love it. We downloaded Netflix to the capsule and were then able to download shows from Netflix to the capsule.  We put the nebula capsule in our mini van on a tripod and placed it on the floor and th kids were able to watch all of their Netflix shows while on our road trip. It made for a much happier ride for the kids.Also, we had lost the remote. I emailed Nebula capsule customer service to purchase anew remote and they sent me one for free.My wife and I also found a lot of enjoyment out of this capsule. I downloaded our favorite movie “Forgetting Sarah Marshall”on to the Netflix app on the capsule and we watched it in our hotel room wall at about 10 feet in size.So much fun and a great device. Great sound and great picture for something so small. This is the first review I have ever written on amazon and it’s because this is such a good buy.",5,2018-07-10 00:00:00.000
"Buddhagem","Amazing device that does EVERYTHING!","This mini projector is simply amazing. The size is the first thing that grabs your attention. This thing is tiny. It’s the size of a soda can. So I was skeptical that the images would be very good. Boy was I wrong! The sun hadn’t even went down yet and we were playing it out on our terrace and the image was still bright and vibrant. The ability to download apps like NetFlix, Amazon Prime and Plex is huge! Within minutes I had my entire Plex library at my fingertips. The companion Capsule App for IOS works great. The standard remote is fine but with the app I don’t have to worry about bringing one more thing. The speaker is fine but we typically hook it up to one of our larger Bluetooth speakers for more robust sound.Last night I took it in the bedroom and watched a movie on our ceiling with the sound pumped in to my airpods. The picture was amazing even just projecting it onto a white ceiling. From our bed up to the ceiling I still had a 50” screen. It was so fun!This thing is great. You can download just about any of your favorite streaming apps. You can mirror your smart phone or tablet. You can plug a USB drive into it. There’s really not much you can’t do with this amazing little device and the picture is incredible. Included a photo I took as we were getting ready for our first movie in the park!",5,2018-07-22 00:00:00.000
"doodinvegas","Cabin Tent Glamping","Wow...this little device is amazing!  I just came back from camping up at Zion National Park in the Watchman campgrounds.  The walk in tent sites have community fire pits which sort of lend itself to impromptu mixed groups of campers congregating and after a few beers their voices echo loudly.  It was great to be able to play various movies I had downloaded to my Netflix app and play from my phone and the awesome 360º sound somewhat diminished the campfire ambient noise.  And, I am sure people were like.....IS THAT GUY WATCH A MOVIE IN HIS TENT?  hahahahah  Sure, these might be more expensive than some others, but, the colors popped, the sound was great and all the little design features justify the cost.  Just a heads up....It cost me $40 for a micro-c to hdmi cord so I could watch netflix from my phone to the projector.",5,2018-11-26 00:00:00.000
"BLADE","Entertainment in a soda can","I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife & she really likes it.  The device is the size of a soda can. I purchased the red colored one & it looks like it was made by Stark Enterprises (Ironman).  The device can be charged & movies watched without bulky cords or outlets needed & USB drives can be attached to view whatever media you have stored. The picture is good, the brightness is good, the control functions are good.  My wife uses her iPhone to manipulate the device for the most part, but it does have a remote.The complaints I’ve heard was it wasn’t 4K & some other Star Trek $#%@ that it can’t do! REALLY PEOPLE, it’s the size of Coke can & allows you to watch movies while camping, tailgating, or chilling in the hot tub at night in the backyard.  I guess, due to the fact, that when I was a teenager telephones still had a cord attached & gasoline was less than a dollar!  I’ve learned to curb my enthusiasm & have realistic expectations of where we are with the technology; especially at a consumer friendly price point, that this product comes in at.  This device more than meets & actually exceeds what I hope it was capable of.  Smalll, compact, portable, sturdy design, good picture quality, good sound quality, a plethora of apps (VUDU, NETFLIX, YOUTUBE, etc), & aesthetically beautiful.",5,2019-01-10 00:00:00.000
"Sandro","Excellent so far...","Been using it for a week so far and i’m pretty happy with it. size is small but has a nice weight to it. well built. it is bright enough even with some lights on. User interface is very easy to use and navigate. Remote is decent enough but would have been so much better if they used bluetooth, as it is it needs line of sight in order to work but they do have a phone app available for iphone and android. would have like to see more i/o ports. only has one micro usb to charge and a full size HDMI. All in all this is a great little projector to use ANYWHERE, but specially when traveling on vacation or camping. it projects a good picture even on a gray wall 5 feet away. the speaker is so much better than any other Pico projectors, personally I have tried 4 others with similar form factor. this is not a bose speaker but it is very good to watch any movie. not much of a bass but i’m sure it is phisically impossible to get anything better in such small space. I also looked at getting at their own nebula protective case but after close inspection I ended up paying half that for a superior case from hermit shell brand with a much better accessory layout, just don’t stick the remote all the way in or it may be hard to get it out.This little projector had the best projected image of any other pico projector I’ve tested and good solid performance. Yes it is more expensive than the competition but in my opinion we’ll worth it.PS. forgot to mention that Anker did NOT sent me a unit to review, I paid for it myself with no regrets.",5,2018-04-28 00:00:00.000

"dbug","I Want this Nebula to Work with Updated Review","Update: 08/07/18I tell you what. This company is amazing with customer support. I had to bump it up to a 5 star review.  They acknowledged my issue and tried to solve the problem right away. As it turned out, it was a faulty device. They were so apologetic. The customer service worked hard to try to resolve the problem and I will be their customer for a long time.Previous review:I really want to love this product. It has its good and bad but the bad just weigh much than the good. I'll start with why I will return this product even though I really wanted to love it.The BAD: The focus ring is my biggest issue. I'm projecting this on my 95 inch screen in a dark room and I constantly needed to refocus the image projected on the screen.  It would not stay in focus. Everything becomes just blurry enough that I can't even read the fonts clearly. Just a slight turn of the ring will focus it and then it would eventually go out of focus again. I needed to repeat the step every few minutes through out the whole movie. I also noticed that not the whole screen gets sharp picture. If I concentrated on focusing the middle part of the screen, the outer part becomes a little blurry and vice versa. I can't get 100% of the screen to be focused. This is bad enough for me to return this product. What is the point of having a projector and have blurry pictures.Now, the android's app. I have the Galaxy S7 Edge. You need the Nebula app to control Netflix. Not a problem, but the app would freeze when I try to scroll for movies. I thought it would be a small glitch, but I run into the same problem every time. Everything would stop moving. I needed to hit back and open Netflix again and wait for the app to reconnect to the capsule again. Very annoying.The remote receiver is also behind the unit and you need to point your remote toward it from the back for it to function.Now, the Awesomeness: Very small and portable. It's basically a wireless unit. Very sharp and sleek and an awesome show piece. I have it connected via Bluetooth to my",5,2018-07-19 00:00:00.000
"Safari Man","My  favorite LED projector by far! Ticks all the boxes.","I bought this Nebula Capsule for a trip to South America to visit family (to show home movies and pictures). It is about the same size as a can of coke, so it is small, but boy does it pack a punch. All of the other projectors I have used were shaped like smartphones, so I was a bit thrown off by the shape of the Nebula. But let me just tell you right now, this can shape is great! I really can't say there is anything I did not like about this unit when it comes to the major features. It just ticked all the boxes. They got a lot of things right on this unit.Things is really liked.1. Great Speakers!The main thing that was wrong on the other four units I have used was the speakers, which were all but useless. That is not the case with this Nebula. I showed videos to groups to over 30 people in an outdoor setting and no one had any trouble hearing clearly. Since all my previous LED projectors had basically worthless speaker, I was not expecting anything different out of this Nebula, so I bought the OontZ Angle 3 Portable Bluetooth Speaker to use with it. I did a side by side test with the OontZ Angle 3 and there is no question that built-in speakers on the Nebula are noticeably louder. Sound quality wise, they were very close. The OontZ Angle 3, I would say, had a little deeper base which might a little better for music, but the speakers on the Nebula were clearer and sharper, which is better for voice. Both speakers produced quality sound.2. Amazing Battery LifeThe thing about portable LED projectors, is that they are intended to run on battery. If you have to be hooked to AC power, why go LED in the first place? But the issue I have always had with the smartphone-shaped LED projectors is that they did not have enough battery life to play a full 2-hour movie on max brightness. Most of them top out at about 90 minutes of battery. That is not true on this Nebula. I was able to show two full-length Hollywood movies on it at max brightness and max volume with battery life to spare.3. Good Brightness.I am not going to say that this tiny projector can blow your 2000 Lumin Halogen full-size projector out of the water, but it has enough brightness to get the job done. I used it for three weeks showing movies nightly in South America and not once did I hear a complaint about the brightness from anyone.4. Color AccuracyOne thing I have always had trouble with LED projectors is color accuracy. On my other units, I was always trying to mess with the settings, trying to get the color right. Not on this Nebula. The color and hue on this Nebula was spot on from the factory. I never even looked for the color settings.5. Can be Powered with an External Battery PackFor me, this is just a common sense MUST for a portable projector. Unfortunately, as baffling to me as it may be, there are some LED projectors that CANNOT be powered by an external battery pack (like you would use to charge your phone). Even though I never need this feature due to the over four-hour built-in battery life, it is still something I consider very important to have on a portable projector.Things I feel could be better.1. Only 8 GB Internal MemoryConsidering that memory has gotten extremely cheap these days, I was very surprised to find that the unit only had 8 GB of internal Memory. Considering that the unit does not have a built-in SD card slot for extra memory, this was surprising, to say the least, but not a deal killer by any measure.2. No Built-in Expandable Memory Slot.This was another surprise to me that I did not even think about looking for because I just assumed it would have it because it is just a standard issue thing on electronics nowadays. The Nebula does have a mini-USB port (same as most Android smartphones) and comes with a USB adaptor cord that allows you to expand the memory with a USB Thumb/flash drive. Instead of using this, I chose to use the Transcend TS-RDP9K USB 2.0 OTG Card Reader, that accepts micro-SD cards, which is what I use more of. I was able to play videos from it without any issues through this port with my card reader.3. Same Port for Expandable Memory and Charging.If there is a real con on this device, this is it. It's not a deal breaker, but I would definitely like to see this issue addressed in newer models. Again this goes back to the small 8 GB onboard memory. Since the projector has no built-in memory card slot and uses the mini-usb charging port for expandable memory, if you run out of battery while showing a movie from a flash drive, you are dead in the water, because there is no way to power the device and play from a flash drive, since they both have to be done on the one min-usb port. So, in the event, you run out of battery and need to power the device externally, you can only play the content that is on the small 8 GB internal drive. Again, this is not a deal breaker but is clearly an engineering oversight. This problem can be easily remedied by adding an extra min-usb or a micro-SD card slot.4. Remote ControlI am not sure if my remote control was defective or not, but it absolutely could not adjust the volume. It worked fine menu navigation, but the volume buttons gave no response. Fortunately, the projector has volume control buttons right on top of it so it was not a huge issue. There is a remote control Android app for smartphones and it does work, but like most of the remote control android apps, it is kind of janky to use.All in all, I think this is the best mini LED projector on the market. I ended up donating my projector to a local church while in South America, but I will be buying another. For most purposes, this an all-in-one movie studio that is the size of a can of coke. Honestly, it is a flat our marvel of science. Throw this in your bag and you have everything you need for showing movies, viewing photos, videos, etc, etc. I recommend buying the very nice Nebula Capsule Official Travel Case to go with it.",5,2019-03-21 00:00:00.000
"Veecue","Small investment for great image quality","Love it!! We use it for backyard movie nights, and camping. So nice to not require power. Longest movie watched was a little past 2 hrs and worked perfectly fine without requiring charge.Sound was fine for backyard and camping but will need to connect to speaker for louder sound when camping at the beach by the loud ocean waves. Easy to connect to our phone and control from there. Remote comes with battery and was sluggish to work right out of the box because buttons had to be pressed multiple times in order to respond so to avoid frustration we connected to our mobile phone. Resolution was great! Love that it’s compact and sleek design. When we take it camping we get a lot of stop by’s because it catches people attention we don’t have power connected to it and resolution is fine. Usually sits flat on a table but will purchase stand not that I see we need it but just to have. Did purchase hard shell case to protect it and love it!",5,2021-04-07 00:00:00.000
"Monica W.","One of my favorite purchases in the last few years","I love this this little projector. It surpasses all my expectations, and honestly it's probably one of my favorite purchases from the last few years.It's essentially like a soda-can size TV set that can project an image many times the size of our actual TV, onto any suitable surface anywhere. It's like having a portable cinema in my pocket. We have a giant window in our living room with a white roller blind, and turns out it's the perfect surface for a projector—instant movie theater! We used it to play Mario Kart the other day, and it was really cool to play split screen on such a giant surface. We've also watched Youtube videos in bed while projecting it on our bedroom ceiling, and screened movies using a wall at a friend's house. The other day we held a party and used it to do video projections on a way for ambience.I was worried about the brightness, but the Nebula is impressively bright. Obviously it doesn't work well in bright daylight, but you only need the ambient light to be somewhat dim for this to work fantastically, and the smaller the projected area, the brighter it is.The three things that are most impressive to me are the sound, the battery life, and the size. It really IS the size of a soda can, and honestly I can't believe all that picture and sound and battery life fits into that tiny package. The sound truly is impressive. There have been multiple times when I'm watching something like a music video, and I suddenly realize with surprise that all this big sound we're hearing is all being projected from this tiny little can, and it's not actually hooked up to a sound system.The battery life so far has also surpassed expectations. I figured it would be enough to stream one movie, but the first week we got it we were affected by the Norcal blackouts, and we were able to stream two movies with it still going strong.If I could change one thing, it would be the fact that out of it the box, it locks you into their walled garden platform with their own app store, so the apps you install are not the actual Android apps from the Google store. We've so far used YouTube and Netflix, and they are each slightly wonky in their own way. The YouTube is some sort of weird generic YouTube app that doesn't let you log in to your own YT account. For me it means that if you want to play from your own playlists you have to search for it, and also I have to sit through commercials even though normally I have a paid Youtube Red account. Their Netflix app is essentially the desktop Netflix page. It doesn't respond to their remote and only works if you download their Nebula controller app on your phone.  Apparently you can call customer support to get a developer code to unlock it, but I've yet to try that yet.",5,2019-11-13 00:00:00.000
"AuxilioVeritas","A profoundly durable projector well-worth the money.","OK. Right off the bat, this is NOT a daytime-use projector. 100 lumens gets you about as much in the day as a flashlight intended for the use of illuminating the sun. It just does not work in the presence of light (maybe a darkened room... with a bit of light...maybe). Just so you know, I take my freedom seriously. I like to have fun in different environments and indoor movies/gaming are traditions I can not abide.In a darkened room this beautiful piece of simply phenomenal conception is amazing. I am so fond of it that tears come to my eyes when I think of leaving it behind. It is so small, yet the resolution is fantastic. I get amazing resolution at 200 inches (screen size) and surprising versatility for a projector. Suck it Samsung (your TVs are bulky, expensive and strain my eyes).Furthermore, the Nebula Capsule (by Anker) can connect to another device (my Bose SoundLink Revolve speaker, in my case) if you do not like the sound quality (not the same as Bose, but surely impressive with size and all other things considered, right?). Not enough? You can download the iPhone app and use that as a fully functional remote-control for the amazon, Netflix, etc. programs already installed on the projector. You won't know the pleasure and fascination until you have tried it!I like to use this with my Nintendo Switch. With it's battery I can play games in parks (at night), on the roof (yes, I did this... at night), or anywhere dark where a wall or screen can be arranged (you may need either a very long extension cable or several of them - length/number depending on the distance to your nearest electric socket). I had to bring six three-foot extension cables (18 feet total) to the park next to my house to get this to work plus one adapter for the strange-looking socket at the bathroom there. The screen auto-adjusts to angled surfaces, so it does not matter if it's directed at, say, a slanted rooftop. It will adjust the screen and you will be watching happily (although earbuds are recommended if you have fussy neighbors, which was the reason I went to the park).I saved the best for last: this thing is DURABLE! My dog knocked it down from a stand (about 1 foot high) on top of a table (about 3 feet high) and it hit a ceramic-tiled floor (total of about a 4-foot fall) in an area near the lens. Aside from a minor scratch, my Anker Nebula shook it off (along with my horror at such a drop) and functioned as if to say either ""What are you looking at?"" or ""I think my stand may need a minor adjustment..."" or both. It would be inaccurate to describe my reaction at this as mere profound amazement. So you understand what was happening, it was a dark, cold and quiet night; my Dog already spooked the living daylights out of me with his aberrant behavior and I was watching Silent Hill and Toy Story back-to-back. These products are not usually made to survive such falls, so don't be surprised when I say I seriously considered getting an exorcist for this thing. Naturally, my imagining a retort coming from an inanimate object (which was still playing the movie) may be partly responsible for that consideration.In short: You won't need all the king's horses and all the king's men to put a Nebula Capsule back together again. By my experience, it probably won't break to begin with. This is just one experience mind you, and should not be taken as law!In any case, thank you Anker. I use this to give my family eye-strain-free movie nights. It is easy to use with or without the iPhone app that comes with it, so even my young sisters can use it. The smiles on my sister's faces and fond memories of our family together during these movie nights are possible only thanks to you.",5,2019-02-06 00:00:00.000
"obakir","Absolutely amazing","I bought this for one specific purpose and it is performing absolutely amazing. I use it to do a slideshow of some family pictures. I looked at other options to do this, like electronic frames. Good ones are twice the price of this device but what you get is a 10” screen which has to be plugged in.Night time with some gentle lighting the brightness and picture quality is amazing with this device. I have a usb stick plugged into my router and the preinstalled fotoo app on this device read pictures in the network drive, scales them to fit the screen, and lets you adjust the timing between pictures. All with no problem. I have a micro tripod that fits it well. It does horizontal keystone correction perfectly. App is gorgeous. Works every time. It has a live chat support 24/7.Support line is amazing. You send an email and a lady responds starting with an apology for the late response. This nice lady is apologizing for 6hrs! You call att and they out you on hold longer than that. There was a problem with the charger and they send a brand new anker charger in a week.I’m probably utilizing only %1 of what it can do.

"Ronald G.","I love this stupid projector. Great bang for the buck if you're aware of its limitations.","Lovely projector for the money. Super light weight, super portable. The built-in speaker's fine for dialog and light music (I can't imagine anyone using it as a bluetooth speaker, but hey, you can if you want to). The internal speaker seems to be very voice-focused, so speech clarity is quite nice. If you're watching action films, explosions are underwhelming for certain. Bluetooth audio to an external speaker is fantastic (I've paired it with an Aukey bar, and Aukey receiver, an Urban Kanteen speaker, and a pair of wireless buds from the dollar store, no problems with anything, and the transport controls on the speaker let you pause the picture.Unfortunately, if you're running HDMI, picture leads audio by about a half second or more due to the projector's need to re-encode the audio for BT transmission, and there's no way to adjust audio/ video sync in the necessary direction.TIP: get a bluetooth micro-keyboard for much nicer remote control of the unit. The included remote is lacking at best, and the app isn't materially better.",5,2020-02-20 00:00:00.000
"Cindy","LOVE this projector and their customer service!","I have wanted a projector for years for backyard movies and shows and finally bought this one after borrowing a friends. It is great! The size is wonderful, super compact, and even better that you don't need to be plugged in to use it. I wish this cheaper model had auto focus, but that's really my only complaint and it focuses just fine when I do it manually. Besides the capsule being great, the customer service has been INCREDIBLE. Any question I have had, they have been so helpful in answering and their follow up is some of the best I have seen. I updated my software and needed to wait 10 days to get access to something, and on the 10th day they followed up with me first thing in the morning. Their responsiveness, helpfulness, and kindness has been super impressive. Great product and great company, highly recommend.",5,2020-10-27 00:00:00.000
"mommy2boys","AMAZING!! EASY TO USE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX,  GREAT SOUND AND PICTURE, BUY IT ALREADY!","Was looking for a more portable projector than our large epson for movies in the yard or to take camping/on trips.  After being super disappointed with the tiny LG  MINIBEAM projector we purchased from a local store, we ordered this one.  Immediately we opened it up and tested it out with a dreamworks film for the kids...JUST WOW! The fact there is an almost full charge out of the box was amazing, the picture quality was really impressive even with the light spilling into the room from another room. The brightness and color seemed pretty accurate. The sound is pretty loud, no need to turn it all the way up and the 360 speaker is awesome, no wondering if it is reaching all sides of the audience.  The fact you can download apps to stream and run everything off your phone, completely cordless is such a huge advantage over the other mini projectors!!  In the past we have had to drag the fire stick, an external speaker, and  power cords just to play a movie.  From unboxing to movie watching was maybe 10 minutes. Download apps, set it on a level surface and boom your done! Haven't tested the  battery time to see if it is really 4 hrs but either way that is head and shoulders above other devices charge time,(compariable LG minibeam was 2.5hrs on minimum brightness).  All wrapped up in one tiny, soda can size, seriously its the size of a coke can, my husband could fit it in his pocket. The remote is larger than I would like it to be, that said you can do everything from your phone so, you don't even have to drag it along if you don't want to.  I am so happy to easily add this to our camping/travel routine.  It is so compact and easy to use, if you are thinking about it , just buy it already. :)",5,2020-08-25 00:00:00.000
"Chenoa Allen","small and portable, great functionality","This is a great little projector! My priorities picking a projector were - a small, portable projector with its own operating system so I can watch hulu / netflex / etc without plugging my phone into it. The Nebula fits the bill. After I had it a while, I also wanted to watch Google Play movies on it, and the Play app isn't available on the Nebula OS - but Anker customer service was super helpful (and fast!) getting me set up with the beta version of the full Android OS so that I can download and use any apps available in the Play store.There are a few downsides - the remote doesn't work with most apps, so you need to use the phone app that turns your phone into a remote, and that app is clunky. It's not bright enough to watch in bright daylight. But if you are looking for a small projector that is portable and doesn't require extra wires (besides the charging cable), I think it's great. I've always been very happy with Anker products, and this one is no exception.",5,2019-11-01 00:00:00.000
"K. Engell","Super cool little projector","I love this little projector.  It's pretty bright and the image is even great during the day in a darkened, but not dark room.  I love how I can lay on the floor and point it at the ceiling and watch movies.  It saved the night on New Years when we were with friends and the power went out.  I was able to use an app to view live coverage of the ball dropping while using my phone as a hot spot.  Also Anker customer support has been excellent for all of my Anker products.  They reply to emails in less than 24 hours...much less more like an average of 2 hours.  With this projector they helped me add the google play store.  I would definitely recommend this little guy.",5,2019-05-24 00:00:00.000
"Timothy Rogers","The coolest thing ever!!!","I love having the latest gadgets. I always need the high tech crap. Always been an audio/video guru and I have to say this is my favorite thing I have stumbled across. Its perfect in so many ways.I love the controls and system design. If you ever held a firestick remote, its basically the same. Very easy to use. My 5 year old already figured it out. I already have Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, and Disney + running on it. I used those apps to download 5 movies for when we go to the campground away from wifi.Impressive sound. I see reviews insulting sound quality. If you understand your expectations of what a projector speaker is, you will be impressed. I have a $1200 projector in my basement theater. If you compare the speakers on the projector, this one is much better. In fact it is better than any projector speaker I have heard. I have heard many. I YouTubed new joyner lucas song and my friends and I sat around and all agreed it bumped quite well. Is it a decent comparison to a good bluetooth speaker? No. Is it loud enough to fill a room with excellent sound? Definitely.Image quality...i also see some reviews referencing poor image quality that made me slightly question purchasing it. Lemmie say wow! For a pocket projector, it is a very good quality. Bright vibrant colors. Some are staring at it and comparing to their 1080p tvs. Its not that. However, its a very good image. I have dabbled with cheap projectors. This blows the doors off a standard cheap projectorWith its low lumen output, it is definitely a nighttime projector. But is definitely clear and vibrant. Beautiful colors.I love it so much! Buy buy buy! I would buy again in a heartbeat! Its so cool in every way!!!!!!",5,2020-09-07 00:00:00.000
"ebp913","Awesome portable projector!","We have several friends with large projector displays... huge boxes with lots of wires, a giant screen, etc.  We initially wanted something like that but when we came across this item, it was exactly what we were looking for. We travel a lot and we wanted to be able to bring something small and portable with us without lugging an entire bag of gear.  This projector is exactly that! The battery life is great and the picture quality is awesome for such a small device. I haven't once though to myself, man this picture quality is bad.  It's a bit of trade off but if portability is your biggest concern, this is the device for you.  We use it for watching movies, sports, etc outside and it's perfect for that.  The size is just amazing for what it can do. We've downloaded some movies directly to the device so we can use it when we don't have wifi or cell reception and it's perfect for that also.  Love this thing!  We also got this tripod for it and it's perfect... small and compact and flexible https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074SDW452/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1",5,2018-09-12 00:00:00.000
"JE","Anker Service is the Best - the Nebula is pretty great too.","When we bought the Nebula, I pulled the plastic tab the remote to activate the battery.  I didn't realize this wasn't like a the tabs that come on toys and ended up breaking the battery cover.  I called Anker and, Kevin, immediately sent out a replacement remote - no questions asked.  Great, well and good and expected.A month later, Kevin called back to see how the remote and projector were working - it Anker, they were working great - and then told me about the carrying case.  I had considered buying this case at the time of purchases, but didn't want to put money into it.  Assuming, like other customer service companies, that this was an attempt to up-sale, I asked Kevin the price.  ""No, no,"" he said, ""It doesn't cost anything.  It is for customer appreciation.""  Talk about going above and beyond.  They fixed the issue, called to make sure the issue was fixed, and value added just to make sure we were satisfied.As to the Nebula, is is pretty great too.  We have it as an outdoor theater camera.  We put a mount outside and hook it up to watch movies in the hot tub.  Obviously it needs to be used when it is dark out.  I'm not sure how weatherproof it is, so we just unscrew it and take it inside when we're done.  For the size, the picture quality and sound are great.There are two things I would improve, 1) make the remote wi-fi.  As it is, we sit behind the projector when we are watching movies and the IR remote doesn't work as the receiver is on the front.  You can get around this via the pretty great phone app - but I'm not crazy about having phone around hot tub.  2) The NetFlix app needs work so that it can work natively with the remote (not sure this is an Anker issue) .  The other apps, include Plex, work fine, but NetFlix is a bit difficult to navigate.Thanks Anker, for the service and consistently excellect products.",5,2018-08-25 00:00:00.000
"Pzam","Small, compact and works!","So I was hesitant to purchase this because of the price. I was worried I'd spend and it wouldn't work. But I am so glad I bought this. It is limited on the apps you can download but yes you can call customer service and they will give you the instructions and password to unlock the Google apps. Makes using it so much better. I am definitely happy with this purchase. It does need to be somewhat dark to be visible but once it's dark it is awesome. I know there's a brighter one but I didn't want to spend quite yet. But I definitely recommend this. We use it outside to watch the basketball games and you can make it pretty big",5,2020-08-10 00:00:00.000
"emcube","Impressive Portability, quality and value","With total regret, I ended up returning this product due to the image being *very* minutely off balance, but when making the image larger, it was all could notice on the exact fit wall used. It makes an amazing 9’ x 6’ image (12 feet away) which was great for wall casted Blue Planet (4 foot dolphins!). Best in the dark, but can also be used in low light for personal use, or a budget business use. If in a daylight setting - it does better about 3-5 feet from the projection surface. The speaker works well, but I paired it with a Bluetooth speaker (highly recommended) for full depth of sound to match the giant picture. This portable projector is: easy to set up out of the box, the phone app Is well integrated, the available downloads (hulu, Netflix, etc) appear just like on other viewing devices, phone mirroring is easy, the fan is a low quiet hum (less then a desk fan), and the battery lasts the 4+ hours it promises. The little focus dial works easy and sufficiently, as well as the auto calibration to level out distortion when the projector is at an angle (north/south) - just takes a few seconds and it corrects itself for the angle. I’d say the challenge is, there has to be a place in the room it can “live”. It does not correct the east west angle, so if its not centered in the room the picture will distort or the image wont be centered.  Worth buying again to replace. The remote was particular about where it should be pointed for the device to pick up its requests. I had a little trouble with buffering (it was while using Netflix), but unsure if that was all the device or just my internet. I have an Apple TV and it doesn’t ever buffer, but this projector did stall out into buffer occasionally.",5,2019-08-11 00:00:00.000
"Seth","Best purchase!","Before I make any critiques, I absolutely LOVE this projector. I bought it initially because I was stuck in the Army barracks and not able to do much because of COVID and needed some entertainment. For its price and size, it is absolutely unmatched. The quality of video is absolutely amazing and when focused is just as good as any TV. The brightness of course could be better but again, with the price and size of the projector I was beyond impressed. I also love how you can download just about any app to exist to watch whatever movies you want on the go. I’m not a huge fan of the remote, it seems like it’s functionality is very limited with a lot of the apps and sometimes bad on connection— easily fixed with the Nebula app. You can use the mouse mode to control everything. Brilliant product and I highly recommend it",5,2020-10-15 00:00:00.000
"Stepchild75","Netflix - Android phone workaround","Although I didn't really notice the small print in the advertising that Netflix can't be mirrored from an Android phone, due to copyright content.  I found a workaround.  The person I bought this for only accesses the Internet through her phone, so mirroring Netflix did not work, but projector has the Netflix client built into it..still we did not have a regular WiFi connection.  We had to tither the Smart phone connection, or share it as a Hot Spot, then the projector picked it up.  Phone Hot Spot is fast enough nowadays to work with the streaming Netflix on the projector successfully without lag.The other workarounds, on the internet stated to start playing Netflix on your Android phone, then screen share/cast it, then it would pop up on the projector - no go.  The other workaround was to hook up both the phone and the projector to a wireless hub and Miracast Netflix from the phone to the projector - I did not try this one.Otherwise, the video quality worked great!  Speaker was loud enough. We are satisfied.",5,2019-03-11 00:00:00.000
"Jules","LOVE THIS PROJECTOR!!!","This gadget along with my Eufy 11s robovac have got to be my top 2 favorite purchases/investments this year, if not this decade. I've been eyeing portable projectors on and off for a few years now because I don't own a TV and don't want to bc I find them clunky and easily outdated. So I tend to watch videos on my laptop instead. That's gotten hard on the eyes over the years and not so great for when I have guests over. I've only had this little powerhouse for less than a week but I'm already in love! I'm pretty indecisive, esp with large purchases, so I looked at a lot of options before opting for the Nebula b/c it's kind of expensive relative to some of the other pocket projectors out there. But over the years, it's the one that keeps popping up at the top of review articles/lists and had the full gamut of things that I was looking for. So I finally bit the bullet and I am SO, SO glad that I did!The Pros:- Truly Wireless: I've seen other options that didn't have bluetooth compatibility or issues w/airplay or screen mirroring. Not this guy. I've read other reviews have issues with some of the apps but maybe I'm just lucky or don't use as many as others b/c I've had no problem finding, downloading or playing from the apps I typically use. For background, those are: Amazon Prime Video, Rakuten Viki, Youtube, Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, and ESPN.- Crisp video quality: I'll upload a pic once I remember to take one soon but it's defo been great video quality for me!- Strong Battery Life: it lasts about as long as advertised, ~4hrs give or take and that is pretty darn good! When I'm binging and need battery to go longer I just plug in my portable battery pack and voila! Hours more play time.- Great Audio: powerful speaker quality, didn't have to connect it to my bluetooth speaker even once (in fact, it doubles as a bluetooth speaker on its own!)- Automatic Keystone Correction: the automatic correction isn't always perfect, esp if you try to project from an angle but it's still pretty cool that it has it as a built in function! And there's an option to override it and adjust manually as well.- Good Heft: it's got a good weight to it. That's not to say it's heavy or inconvenient at all but it has a weight that feels sturdy and non-flimsy to me.The Con:- No zoom in/out function so it's not quite as simple as placing it anywhere you want and getting the size & straightness you want. Still, given it's small size and sturdy weight, it's still pretty convenient once you fiddle around and get the right balance/location for it.- The cooling fan can be quite loud (almost as loud a traditional/old school projector) so when you're navigating around before playing a video you can definitely hear it and that kind of annoys me but it's not an issue at all once you start playing a video and the audio drowns it out.- Tripod sold separately - not a huge deal (see note above re: zoom) and I know most projectors don't include one either but for the price it would've been nice to have included and would've made the initial set up a lot more seamless.",5,2020-09-24 00:00:00.000
"b&e","Good for the important stuff. Drawbacks are annoying but not deal-breakers.","UPDATE, June 2019: My dog knocked my projector off the table, and it fell a fairly short distance to the hardwood. It stopped charging after that, and an independent repairperson said it was unfixable. The customer service at Anker was very receptive and agreed to send me a new one, which just arrived. A+ customer service, and pushed my rating from 4 to 5 stars.I've had this for a few days. All the specs you would buy this for are great, but as other people have noted, the OS is clunky and limited and some of the hardware is average. Here's a few notes on specifics.  The brightness is fairly low (during the day with the curtains drawn I could barely see dark colors). The sound quality is alright, but you can hook it up to Bluetooth speakers.  The inputs: the USB to micro USB dongle means you can't plug in a USB and keep the projector charging at the same time because it charges on the only micro USB port it has? Why not just have a USB input?  The Firefox browser you can download has no way to close pop-up ads, so if you stream sports/movies/shows from sites that require you to close a couple pop-ups, unless there's a workaround I don't know about, you're SOL unless you hook up another device via HDMI or mirroring. The browser itself is almost useless.  I don't know if there's a workaround for casting from an Android phone, but so far mine can't do it, though it's really easy with iPhones. Which makes no sense given that this has an Android OS.  I don't know why it has games. They don't really work with the remote or phone app. If you're going to have games available, at least make them playable.  The app store is as bad as everyone else has already said, but apparently there are workarounds.  All that said, I still love it. It was either this or a TV, and I am way happier having this portable little thing than a bulky gross TV that would feel like the focal point of my small house. I also prefer it over a standard projector just because it's so versatile and portable. You can even download movies on Netflix (or probably a thumb drive) and run this on battery so you can watch movies outside. Despite the imperfections, it's still awesome.",5,2018-12-03 00:00:00.000
"Kazi Sohana","Great customer service","I purchased my nebula projector recently and I love how it’s so compact and the picture quality is great even though it is so small. I did have an issue with the screen ratio and contacted the anker nebula help email. The quality of their service was beyond anything. They promptly replied to me and helped me fix my issue within a few days and I honestly, think many big companies should take a lesson or two from their customer service reps. They even sent me items to help me fix my issue with the screen and I must say, I’m a lifetime customer for them now. Guys, if you have issues, contact them. You will not be disappointed.

Very bright, very clear picture whatever distance your at. The picture shown is the video when the sun in down but there is still some light out.

Easy to set up and start streaming quickly. Built in speaker is good enough for most occasions, but easily connects to a larger Bluetooth speaker if needed. Picture quality and brightness aren’t going to be comparable to full size projectors, but still looks good in a dark space. The internal operating system is constantly improving where you have access to all your streaming services. Of course Anker has excellent customer service and they are quick to help you troubleshoot any issues you have. I would highly recommend this projector for an outdoor movie, traveling or just as a way to watch a big screen occasionally on your wall at home. A tripod is helpful for perfectly positioning the capsule.",5,2020-09-16 00:00:00.000

The next day I called customer support and received assistance with getting Hulu and HBO Max along with other apps compatible with my nebula. Since then, I have had no problems and I’m extremely happy with this product and very happy for not giving up and calling customer support.

The battery charges up quickly and lasts at least long enough for a movie. I did not rate the remote because I do not use the remote.As with other reviews, I think they could have done a better job on the speaker. It works fine, but for the price point, it’s no where near the sound quality of my portable JBL. So, we run the sound through the JBL. I think I’m being picky though, and I would still buy it again, even using just the built in speaker.We use this on the patio, on the garage door, on the dock, and even on the kids ceiling.

"Good Times","Very cool and excellent customer service!","* Initial review*First off - this is a fantastic idea and rock solid device! Works great and is mobile as can be, which we love!Initially, after spending time with support, I was eventually told Hulu does not work on this device. If you are planning to download the Hulu app from the App Store, note that it will not work. Or at least it did not initially for me, even though I followed the instructions and even called tech support.They do mention in their description that mirroring or casting Hulu will not work but they mention the app will. It definitely did not work initially, even after spending quite a bit of time with tech support.*EDIT*Helen from the customer service team from Anker has been incredibly responsive and helpful and happy to say the projector is now working great with Hulu! I very much APPRECIATE when companies back up their products with fantastic service and they have done so here. Thank you!",5,2019-01-04 00:00:00.000
"Donella Muzik","Astonishing product — great picture and easy to connect!","We are in love with the Nebula Capsule! Purchased for my husband as a special surprise, and he and the whole family are having a blast with it. Set up was a snap, and all devices (PC and Mac laptops, iOS smartphone, Android smartphone)  have been able to easily connect. The sound is outrageous for such a tiny machine, and the picture offered amazing clarity. We did a big family test running the native Amazon Prime app — Black Panther looked and sounded better than we could have imagined. We projected onto a large, smooth white wall, with the image at about 4'x6'. Stunning! My husband also screencast to it from his Windows Surfacebook and had zero trouble establishing a connection. He is excited to use it with customer presentations. It's not often that a product is as out-of-the-box awesome as the Nebula Capsule. It does everything it says it will and does it quickly without fuss. If you are looking for a fun little projector that has the brains of a smartTV, the audio power of a home theater, and incredible versatility, don't hesitate. The price point for such a powerhouse is excellent.",5,2018-05-22 00:00:00.000
"Anita","Nebula Capsule vs. Xgimi Mogo Pro – why I chose the Nebula","I’m writing this tome of a review, because I needed it when I was looking for a portable projector. Hope it can help anyone else in a similar situation.I’ll preface that I was looking for something compact and highly useable for video viewing. I liked the idea of being able to take a projector wherever (camping, road trips, vacation, to a cafe, etc.) and wanted something I would actually reach for regularly. I already own a nice Optoma HD movie projector for home use, but it is large and has a classic bulb design (the image quality is so beautiful though). I used to be a proper film projectionist, so movie quality matters to me.Things I wanted: something in the smallest form factor/portable, most budget friendly, most user friendly projector, and a solid all-in-one. Other details that may be relevant: I’m a Mac/iOS user, but have a couple Google products around the house, as well as a Roku stick. I was willing to go up in price point if the Mogo Pro was so user friendly that I’d pick it over my Optoma for more everyday use (the Optoma uses a standard bulb and gets fairly warm, which makes it unpleasant to use in summer months).I decided to keep the Nebula Capsule. Here’s why:The Xgimi Mogo Pro was great. I bought it because of its native 1080p resolution. It’s the smallest form factor out there with true HD resolution. A few things make this projector less useable for my situation.- Netflix compatibility is still non-existent (there are workarounds that run the gamut of coding java on a PC to sideloading apk files that aren’t fully integrated into the AndroidTV system). I use Netflix often, so this was the first hurdle. **Update: There appears to be a way to use Netflix on the Mogo Pro! Check the video that was posted by XGIMI-Direct in the “Customer questions & answers” Amazon section- The projector does not fully function without the remote. You can cast things to the projector (which works well, by the way), but you can’t use your phone to type in specific text like you can with the Nebula Mobile App. If you’ve ever typed something with a remote, you know how frustrating that can be.- The charger is an AC adapter! Ugh. Not USB-C. Not even micro USB. Feasibly using this on a camping trip — nonexistent. The convenience of being able to charge this in a regular car, or to quickly unplug another cable in my room to charge the projector — not possible with the Mogo Pro (I always have a micro USB close by, but I can’t fathom keeping an obscure AC adapter using up plug space all the time).- The fan exhaust is in the back and due to the shape of the projector, I’m worried about overheating/damaging the projector when projecting on the ceiling. The Nebula Capsule also has a fan exhaust on the back, but due to the shape of the capsule, you still get air release.- The sound on the Mogo Pro is not optimized for video. Music can overpower dialogue quite easily. I think this is because the bass is stronger on the Mogo Pro. Neither projector sounds amazing, but I think the Mogo Pro sounds slightly better when listening to music. I did not spend this much money for a mediocre bluetooth speaker. Like that is not the point here. There is no way to adjust EQ on the native machine.- Battery life is worse than the Nebula, and power saving mode on the Mogo Pro has strange colors (very green), which you are forced to use once the projector goes under 20% battery. So really, you have 80% of video watching time on the Mogo Pro. The projector is not just “dimmer” as you might expect in power save mode, and you can’t toggle it off once the battery is less than 20%.The Nebula Capsule is also great.- The Capsule is the smallest form factor projector with keystone correction, decent ANSI lumens, battery, internal speaker, and at least 480p I could find. Probably half the volume size of the Mogo Pro overall.- You don’t get AndroidTV, but the Capsule is still very useable. You can download apps from the Google Play store by contacting customer service to get access (a one time thing). The UI is a little clunkier, but it does every job I need it to without needing my Roku. (Hello, portability!)- There’s a mobile app that replaces the remote entirely (I don’t have to take the physical remote when we go camping).- Can charge the device from a powerbank while using the device with micro USB.- Vocals/dialogue is clearer and less muffled on the Capsule.- Netflix works on the Capsule! (Although, I believe they also had issues in the early years of releasing the device similar to what Xgimi is going through now. So maybe there’s hope for Xgimi.)Picture Quality: Xgimi Mogo ProOkay, hands down Mogo Pro has the better picture and video quality. That’s what you’re paying for, and I think that was pretty obvious going in. The colors are more accurate, and the 1080p really shines through. The brightness is not really that different, but if you are throwing from a distance and at night, that’s when things might start looking darker on the Nebula (but you also aren’t usually watching two projectors side by side either). The 1080p on the Mogo Pro is not as clear and crisp as my Optoma projector, but I don’t expect it to. Edges seem a little harsher, and you can see outlines of pixels more easily than the Optoma.User Interface: Xgimi Mogo Pro*AndroidTV is niiice. It’s such a shame that Netflix doesn’t integrate with AndroidTV on the Mogo (yet). Having the Google Voice assistant and capability to connect to a Google Home device is also nice. The UI is snappy, and Airplay (using the app AirScreen) is faster than on the Nebula Capsule. I highly dislike not being able to interact with the UI without a remote. You can get away without the remote if you cast from your device, but it would be nice to have a mobile app remote as well.*That being said, I don’t really feel lacking when I use the Nebula Capsule. It’s not as snappy or flashy, but I don’t need that for everyday use?Sound: Nebula CapsuleBass overpowers dialogue on the Mogo Pro. Vocals are clearly more crisp and distinct from music on the Capsule, which is what I need for watching video. If you listen to music a lot, the Mogo Pro might be a better option as a standalone device, but not for me. Also, it should be noted that neither device had phenomenal sound compared to similarly sized bluetooth speakers. The fan on the Nebula Capsule is also noticeably louder, but nothing obtrusive (again, no one is listening to these projectors side by side, and I hardly notice the fan on the lowest volume setting).Features: Nebula CapsuleThe charging form seriously ruins the Mogo Pro experience for me. You can get full Google Play Store access on the Nebula pretty easily, so AndroidTV, while nice, doesn’t fully trump the Capsule’s useability imo. Google Assistant is so nice to have, and the autofocus on the Mogo works! Vertical keystone feels better on the Mogo, but both work just fine. I like the idea of more internal memory, larger battery, and ram on the Mogo Pro, but the Capsule is still very useable, and I didn’t feel like I was lacking much between the two. I also noticed that battery life on the Mogo Pro only lasts an hour before going into power save mode (you cannot get out of power save mode when the battery drops below a certain point), whereas the Nebula Capsule lasts closer to 1 3/4 hours and will play at your intended volume and brightness until the battery reaches 0% (and it warns you at multiple points when you have low battery, which is nice imo since I may not necessarily want to get a charger when it’s at 20%, but I know to mentally prepare myself for the upcoming 2% battery notification).Build Quality: Nebula CapsuleThe Nebula Capsule feels denser, heftier, and more solid build quality (it feels metal all around). The Mogo Pro is still great quality, but you can feel that the plastic parts are more lightweight. The remote of the Mogo Pro is nicer than the Capsule’s, but the design bothers me. Something went wrong at the design stage. Mogo Pro’s remote is slightly too narrow, smooth, and lightweight. It slips in the hand too easily and the ergonomics are poorly designed. You have to use two hands if you want to use the top and bottom buttons, otherwise the remote will just slip out of your hand. You also can’t place it on a surface to press buttons with one hand because the back is pointy, so it tips from side to side and slips around when you try to use it on a surface. It’s comically bad, but looks nice. That being said, the features of the remote are definitely better than the Capsule’s. When plugging and unplugging my Roku, the HDMI plug was much stickier (and worried me every time I tried to remove my Roku). The location of the plugs are also on the plastic parts of the projector, so it feels like a delicate/worrisome part of the projector.Conclusions: Overall, I would have seriously considered paying the 2x price of the Mogo Pro (got both on sale) if it could replace the Capsule and I could see myself reaching for it over my Optoma in the summer months. The picture quality is definitely much better than the Capsule, but that’s pretty much it. Using the Mogo Pro is much less enjoyable for convenience video watching. You have to charge with an AC plug. The sound is more muffled. You’re forced to use their remote, which slips out of you hand every time you try to change the volume and access Google Assistant in the same motion (they are on opposite sides of the remote). Netflix and Apple TV+ don’t work on the device (Apple TV+ still doesn’t work on the Capsule either, but Netflix does work). Build quality feels slightly less solid. It’s got a lot going for it, but a lot of the design elements feel superficial (look good, bad in practice), whereas I feel like the Anker Nebula Capsule was a little more thought out and tested before putting in production.Honestly, if Mogo Pro JUST fixed 1) the charging mechanism 2) added a mobile remote app and 3) added Netflix useability**, I would have had a harder time deciding whether to keep it or not. That being said, many design elements, hardware and firmware upgrades, are needed to make it more useable. The Nebula Capsule could also consider updating some hardware/firmware. It's been many years since the original release. Maybe some hardware upgrades for snappier use? Android TV? A way to use Apple TV+? I look forward to the next generation of the Nebula Capsule and Xgimi Mogo Pro devices, because there’s so much potential for both of them and they don’t have to reinvent the wheel. For now, the cheaper price and smaller/sleeker form factor is what I'll take. **Update: I still stand by my original opinion even with the Netflix update on the Mogo Pro. Their hardware is still a huge hurdle for usability.I feel confident taking the Nebula Capsule every morning to our dining table to watch something while I eat breakfast. I feel confident downloading videos and taking this projector camping. I feel confident throwing this projector (in a light case) in my bag to take anywhere I need to take it. The useability is very high. There are parts of the Nebula that show its age (lack of AndroidTV), but it will hold up at least until an updated version of the Capsule or Mogo Pro are developed, and I feel good that it was one of the cheaper options (sale price) for its specs class.P.S. I am aware that Anker makes other Nebula Capsule models, but their larger sizes, prices, and picture qualities do not interest me.",5,2021-07-26 00:00:00.000
"William Coleman","Good product with even better customer service!","Used for business presentation and I failed to adjust the brightness all the way up so it was hard to see - gotta play with the settings.  I downloaded a Netflix show on my phone and tried to stream it offline to the projector and some copyright notice came up saying I could not stream this kind of content and that I needed a plug. Huh? I just want to stream a show from my phone to the projector but the good lawyers at Netflix have made this not possible. Instead, if you want to watch movies or shows in an area without an internet connection, you need to download the movies via the Nebula. This is the same situation for ANY brand that you buy. This was a trick that Kevin from Nebula told me. My original review pointed out some shortcomings of the unit but they called me to specifically address these concerns so now I have a number of fixes to try. Great customer service! I know that if I have an issue with the unit, they will definitely be there to support me.",5,2018-09-19 00:00:00.000

It played an MP4 movie from a flash drive without any problem and I accessed Amazon, Netflix and Youtube without any difficulty - after uploading the app onto my phone to control it.  I haven’t watched anything long on it yet but all initial indications are that this will be a good investment.  I will update you if otherwise.",5,2020-12-18 00:00:00.000
"Jewel","This thing is AWESOME!!!","I got this for my family for getting together with people outdoors/socially distanced during the pandemic.  I also bought a portable screen, and I'm going to set it up in the street so that we can watch movies with the neighbors or with my parents without getting too close.  It does not need to be plugged into anything- it runs off battery and is controlled by an app on my phone.  We can stream Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, etc.  It was a splurge, but no regrets.  We are having a blast.  And it's truly the size of a soda can.  We will connect it by bluetooth to some more powerful speakers, but the speaker on this does the trick if it's just my family.  Super fun, cool thing.  It's worth the extra money to not have to deal with power cords.  I'm going to let my teenager invite his friends over to watch Hamilton.",5,2020-07-08 00:00:00.000

The sound is incredible out of this tiny thing. We have had parties and played it outdoors and everyone loves it. The remote is ehh but you can use your phone as a remote as well.Almost a year later and my device would not turn on. I contacted customer service and it was quick reply and they rectified the issue very fast. They even followed up after sending me the replacement to make sure that everything went well.  Very simple and swift.I cannot recommend this more. Best gift I have ever gotten myself.",5,2019-11-05 00:00:00.000
"Buckeye in da Boro","An entire movie night... in a soda can!  It's amazing!","I bought two of these in 2018 as gifts for my daughters in college.  They use them for movie nights as you can watch Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc. anywhere you have wi-fi and all from this tiny projector... literally no cords attached.  I always regretted not buying one for myself, especially as we have been social distance gathering in the back yard, so they bought me one for Father's Day.  The one I got had some issue where it wouldn't hold a charge, and they bought it a couple months early so Amazon wouldn't take it back, but Anker offers a one year warranty.  Literally one online form to fill out and one email, and I mailed it back (free) and got a (free) replacement in less than a week.  Great customer service from Anker!  Just enjoyed a movie night in the back yard from this amazing device.  I love it!",5,2020-07-26 00:00:00.000
"M. Beth Van Ven","What a cool smart little projector","Wow!  In our VW EVC set the capsule on the top bunk and add a white cloth and it was Magic!  Runs pretty well with WiFi, a bit frustrating to set up but once we got it going it ran about 2 1/2 hours but it was fantastic that you can connect a battery while it keeps running. The HDML port to my Kindle was amazing!  Knew we would be without WiFi so I downloaded a few movies (Bloodshot) and was just awesome!!  Haven’t tried the DVD player yet but it’s on the list!  Sound is great, size is a pop can and a neoprene cozy keeps it safe as there was no bag or case as I’d seen in some unboxing reviews. It’s very nice to have a manual focus and the remote control works pretty well.",5,2020-08-23 00:00:00.000

"Meher","Died in two years (Updated)","Update: Anker's support team followed up with me and went above and beyond to resolve my issue.===============The bulb stopped turning on. I was told that this had 30000 hours of life and I had come even barely close to that amount. Because I am out of the warranty period, Anker is refusing to support me in any way - they don't even want to give me instructions on how to fix it myself or give me the correct part numbers. I tried contacting some repair stores nearby to see if they'd fix it and they all said that they cannot fix it. I tried searching online for instructions on disassembly but I got nothing. So I basically have a can that should have been worth a couple hundred bucks but is now sitting useless because Anker refuses to provide even a minimal amount of support.I'd recently purchased a Nebula Mars as an upgrade (prior to this projector breaking down), but given this level of lack of support from Anker, I'm considering returning my Mars.

"Daniel Chavez","Product Quality, Company Response/Customer Service are Unrivaled","PRODUCT QUALITY:I absolutely LOVE this little Nebula Capsule and am VERY impressed with Anker as a whole.  The projector is straightforward, easy to use and is about the size of a soda can.  I struggled a little with the initial setup because mine arrived with one of the (many) Asian languages pre-loaded and I had to guess where to go to find English in the settings. Turns out it wasn't that hard by following the settings icon, and it probably would have been much easier if I had just emailed customer support.The image is super clear, and the sound is great for the size speaker that it comes with.  Don't expect it to be loud enough for a giant backyard projector with lots of ambient noise, but there is Bluetooth sound capability for the times when you want it to be really loud.  I connected mine (via Bluetooth) to my home theater surround sound and projected on an outdoor giant inflatable screen.  We were very impressed by the image quality and processing speed of the projector streaming a Netflix movie over WiFi (6 Undergound - with lots of fast movement and detailed sound efffects).  Zero lag on sound or image, and no pixelating on high-activity-fast-movement scenes.  Solid product.The phone app (phone becomes a remote/mouse pad) is great too, and I find myself using it often.COMPANY RESPONSE/CUSTOMER SERVICE:I had a few questions for Anker after receiving the projector and emailed them, expecting to hear something back within 5 days or so like a normal company.  They responded within 24-hours (sometimes less), and provided expertise and tons of support (even voluntarily following up with additional emails to see if I had succeeded with their advice).  Wow.  I can think of many household name companies that can learn a thing or two from Anker's customer support.Overall love the Nebula Capsule 1 and the customer/manufacturer relationship.  A+ from me!",5,2020-01-15 00:00:00.000
"JCTEXAS","Must have for those looking for experiences vs. resolution","I did a lot of research on this tiny magic can-sized contraption and waited for a discount code that brought down the price to $260 on Amazon.  Knowing its limitations in terms of brightness and that it has a resolution of 480p are paramount in limiting expectations.  But this magic contraption  made up for it.  Just think about the portability aspect of this.  I can sit on my back deck without cords and without having to plug in a roku/fire stick or additional speakers.  I had an adequate budget projector, but its lack of portability and standalone use made it impractical for impromptu use or to take on camping trips.  I streamed a Quiet Place on Friday the 13th as my christening of the device and it was amazing.  Even before the sun set the picture was crisp and after it was dark the quality of this product shined.  Projected onto a 100% portable projector screen it made for a night of fun for all that came out.  Its is also important to note that there is a small hard drive on board, and with the Netflix app you can download movies to the device to play offline while camping or away from wifi!  While I have 4K HDR TV and PSVR, those experiences are hard to share with a large group of friends, this however makes up for its deficits with its versatility.",5,2018-07-16 00:00:00.000
"Nathaniel","Super handy and functional on the go projector an smart tv.","I purchased this and the Capsule II.  Hands down I like this version in almost every aspect.  First, don't expect this to be used during the day in a bright room. Otherwise, it is crisp and clean image.  The manual focus dial works fine, but isn't as good as the auto focus on the Capsule II (I think it works just fine though).  The speaker is loud and suitable for watching a movie.The best part about this is you can stream netflix or amazon directly from the device if on wifi, or from your phone/tablet through screen sharing/chromecast.  It is VERY portable.  I keep mine in an Anker case but often just slide it in the side of my backpack if I have a quick meeting and connect it to the Anker tripod.The battery life was over 4 hours or so, but you can also charge it while watching if needed.It would work fine as a projector in a bedroom with the blinds pulled down for a kid or otherwise.  I really enjoy this piece of tech.Note, my picture is a comparison of the operating system and sizes of the Capsule II (left) and the regular Capsule (right).",5,2019-10-14 00:00:00.000
"alex","Good picture small package","This projector has a good picture and brightness in darker rooms or at night. It's hard to see in the daylight but we got it to use for movie night in the backyard and it's great. It auto corrects the angle pitch and can invert the image however you need to project: forward, backward, and even upside down I think. It has a stand screwb mount in the bottom. The speaker is good, but not great. Loud enough to hear across the yard but we connect it to another Bluetooth speaker for better movie sound. You can use some apps directly on the  projector or stream from a mirracast device to it. I'm not sure if it works with Apple products though. It also has an app for your phone that let's you control it as a remote (it also came with a remote too)",5,2021-04-26 00:00:00.000

We don’t watch TV anymore (we’ve never watched cable TV, only Netflix, YouTube, Amazon prime). The screen is adjustable to any size - you can have it from tiny to wall size. The sound is good but we connect it to our speaker for a better quality.The only downsides are - battery life is short!! Super short! It lasted maybe an hour or two! Which is ok for us but sometimes is annoying. Remote control is not working already and we had the product for about 3 months now.

I will probably purchase a block rocket to give that true movie theater sound and annoy my neighbors a bit! If I invite them then they won’t be able to complain right??? Apps were a bit frustrating but once connected it was a breeze...have never used the remote... only the app but certain apps like Netflix don’t really work with the remote anyways so it’s kinda useless.... do not hesitate!

She has all of the typical teen tech so I did not think that there was anything left out there on the market to wow her for her 18th birthday but this did it!  She hung a sheet in her room and will lay in bed and watch her favorite movies.  She did some mild complaining during initial set up  (she is competent but not overly tech savvy) Now that she has figured out how to do it, it only takes her a minute or so to get it started.

"Red Andersen","Light, compact projector with a brilliant and clear picture.","I purchased this projector in response to a discount ad. It arrived the next day, and it works beautifully. It is light, compact, and relatively simple to use. The projected picture is bright and clear. In addition to the enclosed remote control, you also have to download an app to your smartphone to access some of the features and turn your phone's screen into a mouse pad. I'll be using this primarily for outdoor movies during the summer, but it will make a nice addition to vacation travel when you want to catch a movie. You can mirror and project the screen on your smartphone, and I was easily able to access my Netflix account. I still have not been able to access my Amazon Prime video account. It keeps asking me to input the same information over and over again. I will be calling the company's toll-free number for assistance. Overall, I am very satisfied with the performance of this compact unit which is the size of a soda can!

"Mike","Wow!","I read every review and watched every unboxing and review videos. I looked at comparison videos. After sifting through all the good and bad, I took a chance and bought it. Wow! It's a stand alone device that fits in your pocket and needs nothing but a wireless internet connection to play endless hours of video. Unless you are planning to open a drive-in theater or are planning on comparing it to your 4k tv, give it a try. I used it outside playing it on my vinyl siding of my house at about 50"" diagonal before the sun went down. Yeah it wasn't bright enough with the sun going down behind me but just about dusk it was looking good. When the sun set it was awesome. As for the sound, plenty loud for playing outside, even at half volume. Indoors it is definitely more than loud enough. The picture quality is surprisingly good, especially after reading that it's not even 720p. So before you get swayed by the not so great aspects of the reviews, while they may state specs correctly, think of what your use will be and give it a shot.  I don't think for something this portable, you can possibly be disappointed.",5,2018-05-29 00:00:00.000

"Lisa D.","Fantastic if you're not picky about the little nuances","I bought this primarily to watch in my dorm room at college because the space is too small for a TV, and it works great. Out of the box, it looks very high quality and is something I'm proud to show off. Of course, it's not a crazy HD projector, but it does the job, especially in the dark. The image can get pretty crisp when you adjust the focus knob and I don't see any blurriness at the edges like some other PICO projectors have. Compared to my full-size Epson projector back at home, the picture is not as sharp (of course), but it will do for standard, everyday viewing.Now to the cons, there was no HDMI cable included. It's not really a big deal since I have my own, but other projectors I've looked at included an HDMI cord. I feel like at this price point, there should be a cable thrown in there to justify the price. The fan noise is a definitely noticeable, but it's not to the point where I can't hear the sound or get annoyed by it. The remote only works when you point it a certain way, which can be a bit inconvenient, so I recommend just controlling the device with the app. Airplay was also quite laggy for me and my connection was not that weak.",5,2019-12-16 00:00:00.000

"MaryMary","A MUST HAVE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PORTABLE PROJECTOR","Let me start off by saying I rarely submit reviews unless a product has either really disappointed me or has won me over and this product has certainly managed to do the latter.  I was apprehensive about purchasing something this expensive but was lucky enough to have spotted this item as a ""Deal of the day"" on Amazon for about $100.00 off.  Since my family and I have been spending a lot more time outside at night, because of the nice weather, I figured why not give this a try.  I was impressed by the good reviews after purchasing it and couldn't wait for it to come in so I could try it out.  Well it's been roughly a month since I've had it and I've been using it on a nightly basis.  I can tell you it has definitely lived up to it's positive reviews.  It's very convenient to have something this compact to be able to set up quickly and I love the picture quality and the option to bluetooth the sound system to enhance the sound, although the built in speakers are more than adequate if you want to go that route.  I can, without a doubt, and unequivocally write that this product has exceeded my expectations.  The only regret I have is that I did not purchase another one when it was on sale because it would have been nice to have a backup in case anything went wrong with this unit.  Nevertheless, I would definitely buy this projector again if it went back on sale and look forward to many fun backyard movie nights with the kids this summer.",5,2018-06-10 00:00:00.000

This out performs my M300A (300 lumens) at $399 (but I need that for work).The Nebula Capsule has fuller sound and way better looking.Build quality is solid and has a fast operating system.Remote is nicer as well.Again, if you compare the specs side by side the Nebula Capsule doesn’t seem like the choice.

"Tomas","Almost not buying due to customer support","I love this machine in all honesty. Replaced my TVs and opened up a world of space in my rooms. Never had to manually turn it on with the power button in 2 months of owning it. Until my remote failed. I changed the batteries, angled remote everywhere I could, and just gave up and started to power on from the device. I called tech/customer support and spoke to Kevin who laughed at me for wanting a remote control capable of turning my device on and off, ""the remote control was not designed to power on the device."" Okay, so me using it for 6 weeks with no issues was just a fluke and who's dumb idea was it to make a remote control without a functioning power button? Well I just got my replacement remote that I worked and waited way too much for, and it turns my device on (Wow! Big shock there).Great product and I have no complaints about it, just dont ever call the makers for anything. Kevin will answer and try to tell you that projector only projects when you're not looking or the charger only works when the battery is at 100%",5,2019-06-27 00:00:00.000
"Victoria S.","Absolutely pleased in every way","This was a Christmas gift for my father and i originally purchased a completely different mobile projector and it does not even compare to this product. The quality and durability alone is phenomenal. The sound quality is perfect especially with the 360 degree sound projection with the design of the product amplified sound in all directions. I am very pleased with how the projector automatically adjusts its display and is able to match the size of the wall it’s projecting on. I held the projector towards the ceiling and then faced my living room wall and it automatically fit the different sizes of each surface it was projecting on. Absolutely retuning the other projector and keeping this one for sure!",5,2019-12-22 00:00:00.000
"Melanie","Tiny powerhouse","My husband first showed me a video of someone reviewing this projector and I had my initial doubts at first just because it's so small that I wouldn't have imagined it having the capabilities that it does. It's definitely surprising how great this little guy can be. I think the only '""gripe""I have with it is the IR remote as you need to be pointing a certain direction for it to work correctly, but this is easily combatted with the app that you can use to control it. The picture quality is great. I think we currently have it around 80ish inches and it still looks really good. We initially just had it projecting on our wall and even that worked out well for us. With the screen we got- it just looks even better.I just love that we can pop this in our car and take it wherever we go, though we have yet to really do that. But, it is a comfort since we move around often and don't have to worry about our TV being broken anymore since we can just carry this with us. Great value!",5,2019-01-25 00:00:00.000
"ben","Great customer service","I love this projector - we bought it to stream football games and sporting events with our friends in our back yard.  I must say, the customer service is FANTASTIC! I had a question about streaming, so I sent an email to the support email figuring it would be 3 days before I heard from someone, if I heard from someone - it was so quick, they were so helpful, there was no nonsense, just really understanding, helpful people.  We aren't really tech savvy so to have them answer so quickly made the device worth the investment to us!  I use it as a bluetooth speaker in my office and then for movies at night.  Totally worth it.",5,2019-11-04 00:00:00.000
"Bill Cross","Small, compact.","This is a nice projector.  I did some research before purchasing it.  I'm very glad I went with it.  Speaker is good. I do run my sound bar through bluetooth.  It's small yet very powerful.  Easy to operate.  User friendly.It was very fast shipping. Well packed.  Customer service is totally awesome. We enjoy family movie nights with our projector.  Over 100 inches of picture,  very clear.  Projector can be mounted several ways.  Picture can be adjusted for fine tune.  I'd definitely recommend this Nebula capsule projector.",5,2019-01-31 00:00:00.000
"D DEATLEY","Incredible....","Decided to try this thing instead of the top of line one just to see if they even use it at all and wow.... It lights up a 100 inch screen at night just fine with little to no loss in clarity. Their friends houses have different cheap-o ones and there is no comparison to this one that is literally half to a quarter the size. The speaker could be better but who uses the built in one anyways, and this speaker is still better than the cheap-o ones that are larger.",5,2020-08-10 00:00:00.000
"Nate G","Great Customer Service !!!!","I purchased this item a few years ago and I am very pleased.  There was an issue with the MLB AtBat app not working. I contacted Anker Support and was connected with Sharon. Sharon worked with me to update my Nebula. Further, Sharon found a way for me to get the MLB app to work !!!!  She really put effort in and had to do research for this to happen. Can’t say enough about Sharon and Anker customer support. I have always purchased their lightening cables and battery packs but they have secured me as buying exclusive from them. Thanks Sharon!  And Anker.",5,2020-03-02 00:00:00.000

Interesting enough, if I need an electronic component I alway check on the Anker website if this product exists before I purchase. The comfortable feeling  with Anker products is that someone cares and prepared to act on solving any issue regarding Anker.Thank you Kayla for your assistance, you were terrific!CheersM",5,2019-12-10 00:00:00.000
"HKK","Great small portable projector","I had this projector since early this year. I've been using it for our vacations overseas, camping, in my garage while I was working on something. Occasionally we would have a movie night in our kids bedrooms. I sometimes use it while I am in my bed... I project it to my ceiling and lay down and watch all night... LOLOkay, if you are to complain that picture quality is poor I would say don't get this. Compared to the size of this projector picture quality is acceptable to my standards and actually it's pretty good. Sound quality is not bad either. I had no problem hearing the sound and if I needed more volume I would use an external speaker but with it's 360 degree speaker it was good enough most occasions.I stream Netflix, Amazon Prime Video through it's apps or use screen mirror on my iphone. I also stream movies using my DNLA capable NAS in my home network using VLC Player app. I know you can use Chromecast to stream but I don't bother since with the Netflix, Amazon Prime app and streaming from my home DNLA server is enough to watch at home. I had my son connect to xbox one through HDMI in our ski trip that we went with the friends and families and the kids had so much fun and they loved it! Capsule is now our must take item for any trips we make. When WiFi is not available I use the hot spot on my phone to stream Netflix or Amazon Prime or just use screen mirroring or have some movies copied into USB drive and watch it that way. There are many useful features you can use to enjoy your Capsule in many ways in difference occasions.Like I keep saying, this small projector has everything that it can offer to be portable and to my opinion that's the best part of owning this unit. Only downside you may find is ""IF"" you are looking for HD quality video. It's 480P and as your screen size gets bigger it will be blurry. For me up to about 60"" screen size was pretty acceptable to enjoy. Also, do not expect to use this on a daylight. Most projectors are not good when you use it in daylight unless you pay a lot for a high-end unit. This projector works best when the room is dark. I find that having window shades down will help during the day time but when it's very bright day it won't work.I am a gadget geek and I just ordered Mars 2. I am curious to see if 300 lumens vs 100 lumens makes a lot of difference and also the 720p resolution which Mars 2 supports. I am sure there will be some noticeable differences but I am sure Mars 2 won't beat the mobility of Capsule.One of the things that you should consider is that Capsule can be charged with an external battery pack with the micro USB port in the back. So if you are outdoors and have no access to wall outlet then you can connect the power bank and keep watching with extended playtime. For Mars 2 you can't really do that because it requires higher power input than what normal external power banks offer and you can only charge through DC input using the proprietary power adapter. I ordered a laptop charger with enough output and I will be testing it with the new Mars 2 but it's pretty big and it will be cumbersome to carry Mars 2 and the big power bank. I know for sure that I will miss my Capsule's mobility.Bottom line - I like the Capsule very much so far and if Capsule 2 was on the market now I would certainly have upgraded to that but won't be available until mid next year and I'd love to get my hands on Capsule 2 if my budget will allow that when time comes.",5,2018-11-06 00:00:00.000
"Luis A. Sanchez","Get it, you'll love it!","Extremely easy to use! Love all the features. You ca  download Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime etc on it so you can easily watch your favorite shows and movies. You can also connect devices via HDMI and love that I can also connect them to my bluetooth speakers to make it louder.I set it up in my backyard. It looks great in the dark and still not bad when I turn on my pergola lights. Extremely happy with it as its portable so dont have to mount it as I can easily set it up, store it away and travel with it. Go get one!Only issue is that Disney+ wont play from its app.",5,2020-06-25 00:00:00.000

"TB","Love it, easy to use.","Easy to use, great picture and sound quality. So far very pleased. I am concerned about the the USB cord, it uses the micro USB port and that always starts to break down after you plug and unplug over a short period of time. I have a Bluetooth speaker I bought that is no longer useful and out of warranty because the micro USB port will no longer hold the plug in. I don't know what to expect here, but if the port wears out, the Nebula will be usless",5,2020-07-10 00:00:00.000
"Erica Mckimpson","Love this projector!","We use this projector instead of a TV and would not go back! It’s mobile, can connect to a Bluetooth speaker, and works perfect for streaming apps like Hulu/Netflix. The sound is perfect for any room and if you want louder can easily connects to a speaker. We've only had to use a speaker when projecting outside because even with kiddos in the house, we can hear it perfect! We’ve projected it on multiple colored (grey, cream, lavender) walls in our home and even on the side of our house, the color and brightness work well! To top it off, it’s really nice to have the remote on your phone. You can even use your phones keyboard to search and sign in for the apps. This is a great user experience feature compared to trying to type out a password on a SmartTv with a remote! My only complaint is that we don’t have more than one in our house. We honestly couldn’t imagine not having it in our home. Their customer service is great to work with, if you do face any issues. We highly recommend it to all of our friends.",5,2019-10-16 00:00:00.000
"Marissa K. Account","Great quality, Netflix and other apps compatible.","We have tried other projectors and this one is amazing. For the price it’s so worth it. Don’t bother buying a cheaper one, the 60 dollar one I had bought then returned after trying this one.Also if you are looking for a projector to stream Netflix or Disney+ or any other apps. This one does that. We had a hard time with other projectors because these apps would not let us stream them from our phones to the projectors.",5,2021-01-23 00:00:00.000
"Will","Great functionalities and quality for the price","Very glad about the purchase. Good price for the quality you get. Great image quality in dark environment. Small size, so is very convenient to move around. Auto adjust to project square image to a wall or ceiling even if it is placed at an angle. Good battery duration at least when it’s new. Phone app control and screen mirroring both work well.Only two minor complaints. If you control it with the remote, remote has to point at the backside of the capsule. If you screen mirror YouTube from iphone to capsule, your phone has to stay in YouTube app and cannot do other things.",5,2018-06-09 00:00:00.000
"DiazGuam","So good, daughter gave up her TV to use just the projector","It was a Christmas gift to my daughter which she was happy about but only started using in January.  Thought she didn't like it but once she started using it she couldn't stop.  First we were seeing movies on the ceiling! next the hallway, and last night my white sheets went up on her bedroom wall for a gigantic movie screen.  Pretty impressed with the picture quality too.  It is officially now the coolest gadget in the house... sorry Alexa :(It is so small but what it produces is huge!",5,2019-01-17 00:00:00.000

They helped me connect to Android and mirror the screen, they helped me get Play Store support which allowed me to sign into YouTube. So now it is streaming from my phone and I'm signed in!The picture and brightness are in line with what I was expecting from this size and price point. With all the light off, it feels really bright. Some have complained about the ""fan noise"" I don't think it's a problem, I don't really notice it much.",5,2019-10-07 00:00:00.000

I dont like that I have to use my phone to control netflix, because my daughter loves to see the movies in the big wall, but is imposible when Im not at home with my cellphone.

"Mike","Fantastic Little Device - Seriously My Favorite New Toy","I was a little concerned about the standard definition, but honestly the image and color quality are very good. I think so far we’ve gotten it up to about a 7foot image and it’s great. The image brightness is better than I was expecting (although we’ve only used it at night). For the size and the cost I could not be happier. I’m often disappointed with my tech toys, but this projector is amazing!

"lindsey","Easy little fella to use","I was very skeptical about buying the projector, as it is smaller, and so was worried it wouldn’t work properly. But wow. I am so impressed!!! It is so easy to set up, so easy to use. So far I am in love! The only “complaint” I have, is you can’t use the remote control in the apps, so you have to use your phone. This is not inconvenient, it’s actually nice, BUT if you are out of the controller app, the projector thinks no one is watching so it will randomly go into sleep mode. It’s easy to turn back on, and I appreciate what they are trying to do by saving your projector life. Absolutely first world problems, but something to be aware of. Other wise, love this product and highly recommend it. Haven’t “gamed” on it yet, and will update review after I have tried. even though I bought it for movies not games.",5,2019-03-12 00:00:00.000
"M","Best All in one solution out there","I’ve been using the projector for two months. Pros:* seamless connectivity. With Android 7.1, and the big streaming apps preloaded (YouTube, Netflix) you can be watching content within 5 minutes of connecting to a steaming-capable wifi signal* apps on board - I’ve added amazon video, Xfinity Stream,  and TiVo’s apps, which are easy to use once you get used to the capsule control app on your phone ( a must). Plex (with PlexPass) also works well. I recommend doing a little work and getting the amazon AppStore for Android on the device - Anker was able to help me with that. That gives you a bunch more options.* battery life - a solid 3+ hours. You can also plug it in and run it that way* picture quality - you’re not in an IMAX theatre, so be realistic. I use this in a roof deck at night, and just project on the wall. It’s fine. I occasionally hang the projector screen, and that does improve things.* Ease of adjustment - I put mine on a low cost amazon basics tripod - works great.Cons - very few* sound quality is good, not amazing. But I love that you get audio tracks that match up with video most all of the time. I have Roku’s that can’t always get that right. If you need high volume, consider that. But, for a backyard, within 15 feet, it works just fine.Brightness. Works well at dusk. No chance of using it in daylight. Again, realistic expectations.The new Mars II model addresses both these issues. If a slightly bigger unit doesn’t throw you off, that appears to solve the cons.",5,2018-08-13 00:00:00.000
"LG","We LOVE our Nebula","We LOVE our Nebula. We have been relaxing and watching movies on the wall. I bought a screen, but it really isn’t necessary if you have good white wall space.We also bought the tripod, but it is too small, and I’ll rather use our old tripod which stands on the floor. We also bought the case, which again isn’t necessary. I’ll highly Reccomended you buy one by one and de decide if you want the screen, case and tripod.The Nebula itself is FABULOUS..!!!  Hard to watch movies during the day time though. But at night, it is AMAZING..!!",5,2018-06-04 00:00:00.000
"Ohiokid4","This projector is perfect depending on what you’re looking for","As a college student who travels, I love it. It’s not ideal for gaming, since it’s not HD, but I love it for everything else. It’s extremely portable. Sound wasn’t ideal but you can connect a Bluetooth speaker and you won’t experiende any audio delay if you play videos from the native device (meaning you use the built in Netflix app and don’t connect it via HDMI to something else or use screen mirroring). After emailing their extremely responsive and helpful support team, I got every video app working that I wanted (Netflix, Hulu, showtime, amazon) except for HBO NOW. I was advised by their team to buy an OTG cable which I found from Walmart, plugged a USB into it, and tried an older apk version I found online and it worked. I don’t have HBO GO but hbo go is included in the nebula App Store. Hopefully they’ll add HBO NOW soon as well, but for now the solution I found seems to work.",5,2019-01-04 00:00:00.000

When I received it the remote only worked for a short time, however Anker customer service contacted me and replaced the remote.  I will say I love this product but I love the Anker company even more.  They stand by their products and go the extra mile to make sure their products are quality and meet the needs of the customer.  I will only buy Anker products in the future if they make what I am looking for!!!  I am overly impressed to say the least!!!!!!!",5,2019-02-01 00:00:00.000

"Justin Klammer","A great Android projector!","So far I’m loving the Nebula Capsule! The built in app store is lacking but if you contact their support they’ll help you unlock the full Google App Store. Now my Capsule is essentially an Amazon Fire Stick except I don’t need a tv. I can project Netflix, Hulu, YouTube and all the other streaming apps we love.The brightness is decent but you’ll obviously need to be in a darkish room or using outside at night. I prefer keeping it charging while in use so I did have to buy a longer usb cable so it didn’t have to be right next to an outlet. This won’t be a tv replacement necessarily but it does allow for viewing experiences anywhere anytime (with proper lighting). It’s pretty nice laying in bed watching Netflix on the ceiling. I totally recommend this projector.",5,2019-06-06 00:00:00.000

I have never heard the fan over the speaker, so that does not seem to be an issue.The speaker itself is clear and impressive for the size.  I just project on the side of house, and go. I did get a deal of the day price on it, So im not sure I would have tried it at full price, but im glad i did. I think this is going to be very busy this summer.",5,2018-05-29 00:00:00.000

"Miller J.","Worth It! Great for outdoor parties and family nights in.","I originally purchased a less expensive product for a backyard movie party that was clunky, inconsistent with sound and had connection issues.  I returned and went ahead and bought this after having read lots of reviews.  It is GREAT! Super easy to set-up, great sound and picture quality is good.  (It is a projector so not like watching on an HD TV but really fantastic for our outdoor movie parties). In fact, it is so easy to use, we have pulled it out for last minute movie nights projected onto the garage door.Sound is great through the device or you can easily connect to a bluetooth speaker like Echo if you need it to be louder. We rent or buy through Amazon Prime app downloaded on the device and watch movies with easy connection, connect to Netflix or YouTube or attach Apple TV with HDMI cable.  I highly recommend purchasing the adjustable tripod stand with it.  It make a huge difference in being able to move it around in different settings very easily.",5,2019-11-03 00:00:00.000

I was so excited to test it out and had a hard time at first because I wasn’t seeing the menu options.  I wish it had  a more-detailed info on what the iOS remote control app was for and how to use it, but I eventually figured it out.After you download the updates it also has Amazon Prime on the list.The other thing I wish it had is an output (or is that input?) to connect to an external speaker, instead of just a bluetooth option, so that I can have a real surround sound setup for my movie night/or game night.",5,2018-06-21 00:00:00.000

Even did a follow up to make sure my needs regarding the usage of my device was met. I’ve already been recommending this to my friends!

Watching TV in my bedroom on a giant “screen“ (I simply project it onto the wall, it even extends over my closed door) has become an immersive treat!

The picture quality far surpassed our expectations and the brightness was more than adequate for our needs. The built in apps were very useful for our children (YouTube and Disney+ especially) and we were also able to connect it to our Apple TV which made the possibilities nearly endless. The focus adjust was very sensitive but it worked well. We did find it necessary to buy an adjustable gorilla stand for it.

The ideal use case for this device is projecting Netflix, Youtube, etc a 40""-50"" screen on a wall at night in a dark room, on a whim. The ""on a whim"" part is very important, because it is very easy to set up quickly - all you need is a wi-fi signal that could even be your phone's hotspot. No need for power cables, an HDMI source like a chromecast or fire stick, external speakers, or even a phone to run everything. What used to take in my situation 4 devices and 3 power outlets is reduced to a single battery powered device. This is a game changer if you are into impulsive/opportunistic viewing of videos.I highly recommend updating the software to the Beta version which will enable support of Youtube login accounts (so you can watch paid movies), HBO Go, etc.What this is not good for is if you want to watch in the morning (reserve only for toddler cartoons), or blow up the picture to 100"" (pics become very fuzzy), or if you want the best quality sound (no line out for sound, bluetooth sound is noticabley laggy), or want to watch for longer than 4hrs; so be aware of this and adjust your expectations going in. Bigger, brighter, clearer picture, better sound, you need to step up to the Nebula Mars, and even that will not do daylight well.With the correct expectations set, you will be very happy with this product",5,2018-10-30 00:00:00.000
"Lauren Graybeal","Not a home theater in a box, but incredible for it's size and portability","If what you're looking for is something extremely bright, crisp, and fast to watch things like Game of Thrones or even Planet Earth on, a projector of this size probably isn't what you're looking for. However, for its size it's perfect!I use it in my room to watch Netflix (comes installed on the device) and Amazon Prime videos (also comes installed).The biggest selling point for me after buying was the high-customizability of the keystone (aka adjusting the screen angle vertically OR horizontally), which is a feature typically only available on must higher end projectors.  The screen size can only be adjusted by placing the Nebula closer or further from the wall, which was a bit of a bummer, but I found that the keystone adjustments allowed me to get the exact positioning I wanted for my set up.The Bluetooth speaker inside is VERY powerful and adequate enough for most shows, even Game of Thrones. As mentioned, for a home theater set up, this isn't the projector you're looking for, but for just chilling in bed or watching YouTube videos with friends, this is AWESOME.Finally, the Nebula has an option to control the screen with your phone. Not only can you screen share flawless from your iPhone, you don't have to worry about the pesky receiver that can be difficult to reach with the included remote.I sold my old Epson projector in order to buy the Nebula capsule and so far have not been disappointed. It's conveniences and thoughtful features have made it my new favorite toy and definitely something I see bringing with me to parties and trips.",5,2019-03-15 00:00:00.000
"J Woodcock","Wow is this great. Everything included in one small portable package","Wow is this great.  Everything included in one small portable package. No need for cables of any kind. Phone is the remote. This product just throws up a giant TV where you want it. I love the built in OS. Best results are in close to complete darkness. Volume maybe could be a little louder but unit will likely be bigger.  Tremendous product at a relatively low price point.  Had for a few weeks now and gets regular use",5,2018-05-10 00:00:00.000
"Teacup","Excellent product! Excellent support team!","Anker’s customer service team is SOLID! From setting up their amazing Nebula Projector (thank you Kevin and Ashley!) to their Amazon representative’s outstanding customer service (thank you Helen!). They were all eager to help, a pleasure to talk/communicate with, went above and beyond to make sure everything was a breeze for me.  They should do customer service consulting as they have got it down to a science with heart.  Just like their cool little mighty Nebula projector.  I cannot wait to show others this machine.  I’ve already recommended it to others.  I also reiterate that their support team will answer all their questions and be there every step of the way.  My nephew and brother love the home theatre feel.  It is such a blast to have and also quite sophisticated when doing presentations on the job.  Please watch the trailer vid to this Nebula Projector.  Describing it does no justice.  Describing their team does no justice as well.",5,2019-02-26 00:00:00.000
"Sydney","it’s awesome","it’s great. i didn’t want to buy a tv so i bought this instead. i lay in bed and cast it at my ceiling and it works great. great picture and pretty good sound but you can connect it to any bluetooth speaker you have. i could and would bring it anywhere with me",5,2020-04-25 00:00:00.000
"Torsten Banze","Love the concept but wish it had a higher resolution....","This thing is awesome. Is the most portable  decent looking all in smart projector you can get (at a sale price). It really delivers as promised but given the size and shape you will need to compromise on a few minor things. 100ANSI is not getting you a bright picture in daylight. However, its really great in low light and dark environments. 5 Watts 360 speakers get you  sound, but not and cinematic experience. You may have to invest another 50-100USD in a portable Bluetooth speaker if you want some  more impressive sound with your movies. Having said all of he above, I switch from watching big screen movies on Netflix on our 65"" UHDTV to this little guy and for the bigger picture. :)",5,2018-12-10 00:00:00.000
"PJ","works great in dark to semi-dark environments.  easily portable as well","bought this for my daughter's dorm room.  She loves it.  we have several streaming subscriptions, and it works great with Prime and netflix.  she uses it to watch both in her dorm room, and even takes it with her to watch elsewhere.  If you are going to carry it around, i would definitely get a good case for it.  Plenty bright, and she says the built in speaker is more than enough for her room.  this is not meant for a bright room.",5,2019-10-23 00:00:00.000
"Michelle","Great image quality! Worth the price, very portable.","This is super awesome and very portable! I was able to watch shows in the broad daylight with slightly dimmer but with great resolution and image quality. I’m satisfied with the purchase definitely worth the money. Only downside is the battery life which is pretty short if you’re trying to binge watch an entire season in one sitting be prepared to hook it up to a charger! Good news charging is quick!Images include blinds fully closed and then blinds open both are in day time. Night time quality is very vivid!",5,2020-05-28 00:00:00.000

I had purchase two other projectors before I purchased this one and they were not user friendly at all and I couldn't get either of them to work. I decided to spend a little extra and buy this one. We were having an outdoor movie night for my son's birthday and this projector was perfect! It is so easy to use, the picture quality was great as well as the sound. I am average when it comes to using technology and this was really easy for me to operate. We have only had it for a week but we plan on having many more movie nights indoors and outdoors with this awesome projector.",5,2020-08-30 00:00:00.000
"Jonathan Sebo","this thing is *ahem* TOO COOL.  Highly recommend.  Quality construction.","This is too cool and too fun.  Great for camping (just aim it at the side of a tent), for use in the home to watch movies... you could buy a screen or just display it right on the wall.  I'm not a parent but if I had kids I bet they'd have so much fun watching movies on the wall... me personally I use this as a teaching aid, I can carry it in my bag because it's the size of a soda can.  Buy the tripod, you'll need it but the tripod is affordable and SOLID.... for the price this thing is too much fun and too easy to use.  Highly recommend.  I've read the other favorable reviews on this projector and they are accurate as well.",5,2019-08-31 00:00:00.000
"Kimberly T","so much so that my best friend has purchased one and another is getting ready ...","Less than a week ago I bought the Nebula Capsule and I have been blown away...so much so that my best friend has purchased one and another is getting ready to. I've been able to run a video presentation via the USB with no problem, used my HDMI to mirror my computer, as well as enjoyed Netflix movies shown on the wall of our kids room.I called in today for a couple questions and Christian and Ashley were amazing...quick with answers and solutions...all with a pleasant demeanor. Can't wait to see all the ways to use this outstanding projector",5,2018-06-06 00:00:00.000
"Benjamin Remington","Packs a lot of value into a tiny and affordable package.","I use this for outdoor movies when camping with friends. The built-in speakers aren't going to shake any walls, but dialogue and music is clear enough to hear even from several feet away. The projector is shockingly bright for its size and battery life. It's definitely not high-res, but for casual movie watching it's easily sufficient. I'm very pleased with my purchase.",5,2021-06-25 00:00:00.000
"Christopher","Camping and family movie night will never be the same.","Great!

"linouye","Great Portable Projector","This thing is awesome!  The sound is loud enough for a roomful of people to hear and it throws a massive picture.  We tested it in a room that has blackout shades, and it was a little hard to see because of the cracks of light coming through (but still watchable). Once it was dark outside this thing was amazing.  The resident Android OS and ability to download Netflix, Amazon Video, etc. is also pretty cool.  Can't wait to bust this out while camping!",5,2019-04-22 00:00:00.000
"pimp3227","Absolutely a great purchase!","I love the build of this product and it's mobility, nothing like taking an instant movie screen everywhere you go.

We did purchase a tripod to help steady it in most situations, but overall super happy with this product! It's actually the second one we bought. Our son who is away at college uses it for dates and groups outdoors and he can control it all through his phone which is great. We've used it on vacation, as well as around the house...good to use with Netflix to watch movies or shows anywhere!",5,2019-08-02 00:00:00.000

"Jenn","Great for travel but has draw backs","Great little project but I do have a few issues with it. Brightness isn’t the best, you really need to be in a very very dark environment to use for movies. Remote that is provide works but in order to use apps such as Prime Video, you need to download the Nebula App and use the remote on there, which can be an annoyance.",5,2020-06-04 00:00:00.000

"Christine","Clear picture, great sound, and 10/10 Nebula customer support.","The Capsule is the BEST and worth the money. I bought the Capsule in February and it has worked flawlessly - whether I’m watching Netflix or Hulu from the device, using the HDMI, or using it as a speaker. The one time I had trouble connecting my phone with the Connect app, Nebula support went out of their way to help me fix it. (If you’re having issues and haven’t contacted them, I highly recommend doing so).The picture quality is great, but like any projector it looks best and is easiest to see in low light.We’ve been loving social distance movie nights outdoors, made possible by this projector! Can’t wait to take it camping soon.",5,2020-06-07 00:00:00.000
"1ofakind","Well built device and great customer support","Normally I don't write a product review unless it's a very bad or very good product, which Nebula Capsule turns out to be a great purchase. The device is well built and feels solid right out of the box. Easy to setup and user interface is very friendly. I use android, IOS and Mac OS to screen mirror with no issue. The sound quality is also great which surprises me due to its size. The main drawback is the picture quality which I believe is somewhat around 480P to 720P depending on what size you use to project, but it's still good enough to watch just don't expect it's a HD quality. I read in the other review that this device can unlock its full potential with google play store installed which required a special code from customer support so I did contact customer support and ask for the code. Turning out their customer support is also amazing. Adam helped me with the code and provide detail information on how to use it less then 5 mins. Have to give thumb up for such great customer service considering most big company doesn't even have great CS support. Overall device itself deserve 4/5 stars and customer service pumps the overall experience to 5 stars.",5,2018-12-21 00:00:00.000

The projector controller app to use phone as remote control is a nice addition but takes some practice. I can confirm that it is possible to update with firmware to run Google play if you need it and are willing to do some research. Service for this projector, as with all Anker products is second to none.",5,2019-01-09 00:00:00.000

I had two issues, one with price and another with documentation (see below). Kevin and John on the support team resolved each quickly and professionally.A couple of recommendations for prospective buyers: 1. You need to take the battery cover *off* of the remote to remove the battery keeper plastic tab, not just pull it out like every other electronic item I have ever bought. 2. You have to point the remote *directly* at the unit, otherwise it is unresponsive.

But it does struggle when there is light, so I wish it had a bit more lumens. The sound could be better but it allows you to pair other bluetooth speakers.

The picture quality and brightness is great considering this thing is smaller than a coke can, no it isn't 4K but it's also a fraction of the price of a cinema quality projector.

"kevin kee","Super awesome mini smart projector buy it now","Awesome device it's the size of a soda can, solid construction,no need for anything to connect except wifi, screen mirroring,it can be a projector or a bluetooth speaker in projection mode you can hook up other bluetooth devices to it but the 360° speaker on it sounds good enough for any situation if portability is a must then this is your solution it has netflix,hulu,spotify and YouTube  on its app store all work fine for the price you can't find a better mini projector with as many clutch features buy it a tripod and case and you are golden if you're in it for resolution this won't wow you but everything else will",5,2018-12-18 00:00:00.000
"Jay Zandell","WOW, this is cool!!!","Really cool item and functionality is tremendous. Was very easy to setup and operate. Both remote and app on phone control it, can use phone as hot spot and still cast. Throws a BIG picture up that is really clean. I purchased this item to use as a way to show a marketing/promotional video of my company during meetings. The device itself is a conversation piece that helps flow the conversation towards our capabilities and unique approach to everything we do...used it at a friends to watch youtube videos on his garage door, all wireless. The pic and sound are powerful for this little guy. I looked at a lot of these mini-projectors, went to the local electronics stores, and hands down this beauty blew em all away. Highly recommended for home or business use.",5,2018-06-02 00:00:00.000
"Vernon C","Great product!","I had a problem with my Nebula Capsule and Daisy was quick to help!  Kudos to you and very thankful for this little gadget!I like it because of its portability.  I've used it plenty of times and just projecting on the ceilings and walls of my apartment.  This has a very booming sound so no need of external speakers, although you can add one.  Only minor gripe is there is only one slot for charging, and there are no other slots so you're out of luck if you wanted to attach your flash drive, etc.  Otherwise, I love it for what it does!",5,2018-08-02 00:00:00.000
"GARY D POULTON","fantasticoverall","love it in general.  the phone app is really lacking and is a bit wonky for set up.  it seems to have an incredibly difficult time connecting to the device (I have excellent wifi so know that's not the issue).  picture is great, sound is great and I love the built in Netflix and Amazon Prime apps (as well as others); makes watching movies so easy.",5,2020-01-21 00:00:00.000

"M. S. Steffen","Unbelievably small, loud and good picture.","This is a great little projector. Perfect for my personal use. Visible and usable during the day, but don’t expect any miracles. Perfect at night. Good picture quality, good speakers! It’s shockingly small. All around excited to use it!!!CALL ANKER TO UPDATE THE ANDROID VERSION. Many YouTube reviews and others mention that it only has the old aptoide, this is no longer true. or if you are tech savvy check out Reddit for a new GMS code.",5,2021-01-13 00:00:00.000

"Aaron Wang","Super portable projector with great customer service","Things I like:-Cheap-Four hour battery life-Super portable without the need to carry all the wires-Ability to project phone / MacBook screens to it directly-Built-in Android OS with many apps to download-Super responsive and fantastic customer service support!Things I don't like:-using micro-USB to charge is a bit out of date, would be nice to have USB-C-100 ANSI lumen isn't very bright-480p is pretty low resolution but can't complain at its price-FPS is low when watching videos",5,2019-01-15 00:00:00.000
"Chad S.","Solid Picture and Audio Quality","This was my choice after reviewing several other similar products.  I purchased two options, and the Nebula easily won out.  For not being HD, the picture quality is better than expected.  Ultimately I got this for my daughter to use in her dorm and take out and about.  She aims it at the ceiling, which works well too.  The audio is solid for being the smaller size.  Been happy with all of my Anker products that I’ve purchased over the years.",5,2020-02-13 00:00:00.000
"Nia Woods","I love it!","I just unboxed and so far I love everything about this purchase. As you can see it’s literally the size of a can. I don’t have a screen yet so the picture is understandable. I love that it has Onboarding sound if you feel like the actual projector isn’t enough. I bout this for outdoor movies during the summer. I have two speakers that link to each other so this is definitely a great buy. Would do it all over again.",5,2021-04-10 00:00:00.000

"Ryan G. Beckman","Pretty awesome","We use this for my son, who has a vision impairment, and the portability gives us a lot of flexibility. No complaints about the picture or sound. It's easy to set up, and very simple to stream from YouTube or use another device by way of the HDMI port. I haven't downloaded any other apps so I can't speak to them, but it's a great little projector for us.Initially I had problems getting this to hold a charge, but that issue went away when I used the charger that came with it. Just make sure you use the recommended charger, otherwise it will take forever.I was going to give it four stars, but the customer service was superb so that bumps it up.",5,2018-12-30 00:00:00.000
"hannon","Easy set up and easy to use","Simple set up and very easy to use.  Looks good and for a portable projector it is amazing.  Can't wait to use it for Halloween.

"E-cube","Great little projector!","I love the portability of this little thing.  It fits my needs and so far it's been accurate on it's description.

"Sun Kao","Worth It","Product: Well built, definitely compact, speaker sound excellent, and image quality is clear (even in less than ideal light conditions). Ideal for me as I watch nearly all my media through the major streaming apps and have no intention of purchasing a television. Purchased the Nebula tripod to enable optimal viewing angles in my room.Customer Service: I actually rarely write reviews and was motivated by the fantastic customer service provided by Anker. I noticed a price reduction shortly after I made the purchased, contacted Anker, and they promptly answered and issued a refund for the difference. I also was impressed with their persistent follow-up on product satisfaction.Summary: Excellent portable projector that fulfills my needs. Tack on the outstanding customer service, the Nebula Capsule is worth the money.",5,2018-05-23 00:00:00.000
"MJ","You will not be disappointed.","I was really impressed with the picture quality and sound. It was very easy to set up. I rather plug in the Roku stick than use the App Store. It’s just easier to navigate. To use the remote you have to point directly at the can. I watched and read reviews for 2 weeks. You will not be disappointed.",5,2020-05-22 00:00:00.000
"Feanicks","Outdoor Movie Night!","I love this projector! I have had two outdoor movie nights with my 80 yo mom during this pandemic. It is something we will keep up until it gets too cold to sit outside. It has brought us some fun during a very stressful time.It is easy to use. I love that I can connect it to my iPhone and that it is rechargeable. We put the screen up on the fence and don’t need to worry about running an extension cord.",5,2020-07-13 00:00:00.000
"kt","Great quality small sized projector!","Ive had this for a little over a year now and absolutely love it. Picture and sound quality is great. This projector's small size makes it super convenient to use. I also really like the app that lets me control it from my phone. Support for this is also excellent, I had a question once and they were super prompt and helpful getting back to me. One down side of the nebula capsule is it's battery life which is a little short. Overall I would definitely recommend getting this.",5,2019-06-30 00:00:00.000
"Melissa Guillory","Awesome little device","I got this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he loves it. Picture was better than expected. Could be a bit louder for sound but we love it. Plus gets him to go to the man cave. I'd pay double for that alone",5,2019-12-26 00:00:00.000

"vger94","The kids love being able to watch TV in any room","Wife complained about me buying it.  But now she uses it more than I do.  The kids love being able to watch TV in any room.

"Bret Snyder","Another great Anker product.","Love my Nebula Capsule. It is so much better than my older Sony pico projector. The Capsule will go in my travel bag and be with me where I go.Works great with my iPhone and iPads. And I love that it works well as a stand-alone device. My only two wishes would be that it supported ExFat instead of Fat32. And I wish it had a dedicated charging port instead of a shared use port. Not having these do not detract from all the other positives.I own just about every product Anker sells (chargers, lamps, Eufy vacuums, cables). They have great customer service and quality products.",5,2018-03-17 00:00:00.000
"Rex","my kids love the novelty of our own home movie theater","This is pretty easy to use with streaming video services.  Coupled with (for example) Netflix, you have a movie theater wherever.  Somehow, this makes it more special than watching things on TV.",5,2019-02-10 00:00:00.000
"Doc","Excellent Product","This is really an excellent product that simply works as advertised.  It’s perfect for travel and easy to setup (would definitely recommend using a standard tripod which adds even more flexibility).  In addition, the new firmware adds Google Play functionality which allows you to stream directly from the store. Pretty cool. Keep in mind that the resolution isn’t HD. But it really isn’t missed when viewing at a distance.Overall highly recommended!",5,2019-03-29 00:00:00.000
"Jennifer Champion","Yes!","Love it!!! Works great! Picture is great! Sound is good. It has a lot of apps (Hulu Netflix) all the popular ones already ready.

"Da Go","Great value","For the price, this is a great device loaded with features including ability to download movies and project directly from Netflix without phone, wires etc. Sounds is very good.

"Lia","Great product!","We are all loving the Nebula Capsule!  The main complaint in our household is that we need more than one as it is truly a portable TV (better than a TV in many ways).  We took it on our winter break vacation and when we needed some downtime we projected movies and watched them together.  The sound is great, the picture quality is really pretty good even on a dark brown wall (which surprised us all).  We just purchased a stand to make it easier to project it where we want for it to be... it is really awesome.  I wasn't sure about this purchase, but it surpassed my expectations.",5,2019-01-02 00:00:00.000

"Sharon A.","Works as expected!","I was thinking to give it a 4 stars because it does not have a micro SD and the Miracast did not work for me (but I spend about 1min trying to get it to work) but... It hitted the spot on what is important to me!  Dream come true, I can now watch movies and shows on my bedroom ceiling, comfortably. I did have other portable projectors, some are even smaller than this one, but this one is better in any parameter.Image quality:Amazing for the size, although not HD, the image looks nice and bright.Remote:Did not use it once... Using the app and happy.Speaker:Laud, clear and good for watching in bed with the wife. Other projectors speakers are really, really bad.Bluetooth:My airpods are connecting to this one and stay connected when I want to watch silently. I had issues with other projectors.Plex+netflix:Works perfectly.Opera:Works as expected when streaming content.Stand:I have tripod and a screen, but... I did not use them once with this one.When watching in bed, the box that nebula Capsule came with is a great , adjustable stand to watch on the ceiling.When watching in the living room, just placed it on the coffee table and everything was good.Battery:Did not test it, but it is lasting much longer than other portable projectors. I did not need to charge it once when watching around 3 hours of content.Feb-28 Update:Extremely happy...",5,2018-02-24 00:00:00.000

Quality is exceptional, battery last as long as I could expect and is exceptionally easy to set up.  Netflix, Amazon Video, You Tube all work great.The remote app is very helpful although as for IOS Apple devices I can not seem to mirror or stream directly from my phone, clearly a Android platform not playing nice with Apple.You will need to buy a Tri-Pod cause the  cylinder shape does not allow for tilting and easy adjustments on a flat surface but a $16 tripod solved all those issues.Sound is also as good as can be expected, have no complaints so don’t listen to those other reviews.Picture quality is exceptional even though we have only viewed so far on a wrinkly sheet that seems to work just fine for our satisfaction.Bottom line this is very easy to use, fun for the family and seems to be of high quality so if you want to experience outdoor movies made easy this is a must.",5,2018-06-16 00:00:00.000

"Mr.Casual","The future is here and I am loving it!!","I rarely leave reviews, with that said this product is amazing. What truly sets it apart is the Android OS. This basically enhances this projector to limitless possibilities. The screen clarity is decent, of course as you make it larger it loses a bit of clarity. The bluetooth speaker is also good enough for a average size room. Yet you can bluetooth pair the unit to a larger speaker system and use it that way with Youtube/Pandora/Spotify in a party scenario. Back to the Android OS aspect. I Downloaded the Kodi app onto it and basically now can watch any movie or tv show ever made. I then connected it to my Google Chrome and mirrored my phone with the Sling tv app. That allows me to watch live tv on the projector. You can also do this via an Amazon FireTv/stick. I have it on my night stand projecting on my bedroom ceiling. You can mirror your phone and have the weather or whatever else constantly displaying. I then ran a Skype call while having my phone mirrored to it and had the other person staring back at me on my ceiling, which was very space odyssey 2001 haha.

Focus control is sensitive, but when properly adjusted it's pretty even across the picture. Auto keystone works very well. App ecosystem is kinda strange and limited (no Hulu for example - WTH?), but with an HDMI port, AirPlay, and Miracast, it'll do anything you want. Ability to connect to an external Bluetooth speaker is tops. Capsule remote app works pretty well and even better since the very recent redesign. Recommend!",5,2018-03-05 00:00:00.000

"Avid fan","Big sound and picture in little package","I've been genuinely impressed with this projector. We've had other set ups with far lower quality. It's a pain to move around a bulky projector, cords, and speakers with other ""mobile"" setups that you don't leave outside. This is the size of a pop can!As with anything small, you worry about sound quality, but this delivers a solid performance. Plenty loud (you'll almost never be asked to turn it down, though) for outdoor applications. Inside I'm sure it's even better.Video quality is far better than average as well. We had it maxed out on a 100 inch screen and the subtitles were easily readable.On top of all that, it's a slightly dated but easy to use (and most importantly working!) Version of Android. Not the play store, but you can get Amazon video, Netflix, and YouTube. And they all WORK.Battery life is solid at probably 3-4 hours, you'll never have a problem watching a full movie or two.Bundle all those five points together (portability, sound quality, video quality, software, battery) with a $350 price tag, and you have a no brainer purchase.I'd *highly* recommend the stand as well as an immediate addition.",5,2018-01-19 00:00:00.000

"xbrx955","Very good little projector","I bought the refurbished version for around $239.  Excellent condition, would have through it was brand new!Picture:  I could have sworn I was looking at HD.  I guess its 720 or 480p or something.  Enlarged to 100 inches, I could see pretty much everything clearly.  If you have to have 1080- upgrade but spend $300 more.  Very pleased for $250.Sound - meh.  It will work but only a little louder than an iphone, hardly any bass.  It will satisfy you if you don't have another bluetooth speaker for sound in general, but I would recommend pairing with something else with more bass.Apps/Streaming:  Conflicted.  You can sign into netflix and connect it to your phone's hotspot, but if you bought this to stream and airplay stuff from you phone, anything copyright protected wont work.  Even if you buy an hdmi to lightning adapter.  Luckily I have an AppleTV so I just plugged it in and streamed anything on there with the only downside being more cords and sources.  Again - You will not be able to Wifi mirrorcast airplay netflix, HBO, disney etc from your phone.  So I can use it as I need it, but just a  little disappointed I cant just sling anything from my phone for a true portable solution. .  However, plugging in an appleTV takes 1 outlet and an hdmi cord and 2 minutes.  Bluetooth speaker optional.  You can with the built in app for netflix, but its clunky.App for remote - really nice.After buying, I am very happy with the picture quality and will take this on trips or have outside movie night.  I didn't want to spend $500+ so this was a great solution.  Again -I thought it was 1080p until I read up on it.",5,2020-09-28 00:00:00.000
"NHAN NGUYEN","Anker very thoughtful!","I appreciate the product because the form and quality match the price.  What makes me most satisfied is the quality of Anker customer care.

"Jeff C","Amazing things come in small packages!","This is an amazing little device! Full stop.The Anker Nebula Capsule is a pico projector that has it all. I don't even know where to begin but I suppose the star of the show is the projection mechanism. The colors are vivid, motion is very clean, and image size goes well beyond 100"". I have used it on a 120"" projector screen in a dark room with good results. I took it outside and projected on the side of my house which was probably about 200"" with decent results. The bigger the image, the dimmer it will be so anything beyond 100"" really should be in pitch black. It has an accelerometer which detects the angle of the unit and automatically adjusts the keystone to keep the image square despite the viewing angle. There is also a manual control but the automatic adjustment has worked flawlessly. Manual focus of the lens is on a small dial on the side. There is no zoom so you have to ""zoom with your feet"" and move the Nebula Capsule to adjust the picture size. Roughly 8 feet will give you a 100"" screen.So we have a great projector... which is inside a case roughly the size of a 12 ounce soda can. It is an odd profile but there is an omnidirectional speaker in it which sounds incredible and is very loud. There is also a battery which gives it 2.5 hours of run time which is rechargeable with the included Micro USB cable and power adapter.Did I mention that it also runs Android? Once you have connected to your wifi network, you can download apps from the built in app store. There are many streaming services such as Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Movies, Spotify, even Kodi and VLC are present. There is a remote control included which lets you navigate through the launcher and has a ""mouse mode"" button for apps that require mouse input. Playback from the apps was flawless. There are issues with using some of the apps with a remote because there is of course no touch screen. For that, there is a Capsule Control app which allows you to use a smartphone or tablet to control the cursor and enter text. It isn't perfect but it does work.It's also a bluetooth speaker! You can connect to it and play audio through it without having the projector on.There is a full size HDMI port on the back to allow connection of external devices. The USB port does OTG to let you play files off of a thumb drive and there is a short adapter cable included as well. There is almost 3 gigs of free space internally so this can be a completely self contained projection device that doesn't need to be connected to the internet.If you are looking to mount the Nebula Capsule, there are many options. The bottom of the case has a standard tripod mount which, when combined with the ability to flip the image vertically or horizontally, lets you project from the ceiling down to a standard or rear projection screen.For all of these hits, there are some misses. Projecting on the ceiling is totally possible but with a caveat; the case is a cylinder and it is prone to rolling. Plus the IR sensor for the remote is on the back of the case so it is blocked. The focus control is a little touchy and can be hard to dial in. The remote comes with a clear plastic tab to prevent the battery from discharging during shipping and it is hard to remove and easy to overlook which would make the remote appear to not work.",5,2018-03-01 00:00:00.000
"Customer Since 1997","The picture quality is astounding given the size of this thing","The picture output on this device is really good.I can put it on my table in the middle of the room and it covers the entire wall.I am absolutely blown away by how well the image scales.I'm also impressed by the automatic keystone, and the focus wheel is easy to use.Plugging in a Chromecast adds a much needed feature -- at first I was disappointed that it doesn't have chromecast built in, but it makes more sense to have an HDMI input so I can plug in either a Chromecast or any other device I want.The remote control. Hmm. well, it's kind of terrible. It feels very cheap in the hand for one thing. And it uses a button cell battery. You have to be less than 5 feet from the projector and point the remote directly at the IR receiver on the back. It's like being back in the 1990s except my TV remote back then worked better... I seriously don't understand the decision to use an IR remote control on a device that came out in 2016. I guess they had to save money somewhere. Besides that, the remote control app is really good, so I guess that's where the funds went.The speakers... eh. But I didn't buy it for the speakers. It's trivial to hook up a bluetooth speaker that provides much better sound. So I consider myself lucky to have the built-in speaker (Yes, there's only one speaker -- it's mono sound despite the whole ""360 degree sound"" claim) in the event that I forget my bluetooth speaker or its battery goes. I wish there was a 3.5mm audio output. This device was made in 2016 before Apple's whole ""we can't possibly fit an audio jack with all this goodness built in"" decree wrecked audio on mobile devices for consumers. I gladly would have paid another 35 cents for that part.My next complaint: Why do I need to contact their technical support and get a special password to use the Play Store? It's already f****** built into the firmware, they've just disabled it... And they won't just give you the password. I've been arguing with their tech support via email for nearly a week now. You have to justify your use of their special password before they'll give you it. I'm being treated like an untrustworthy child just because I want to install apps from the Play Store.My phone doesn't support Miracast. It's a Google Pixel, so Google has disabled the Miracast functionality in the OS to force their customers to buy a Chromecast. You have to modify a significant amount of system files to restore Miracast functionality to a Pixel phone so the Chromecast is my only option for wireless screen mirroring.It's not that big a deal anyway because I can just hook up a chromecast and mirror my phone to the projector, but that adds more stuff I have to carry around and reduces the overall portability of the device.The executive summary: It's a great device if you have an ""it is what it is"" perspective. It is a really good projector. But nothing irritates me more than a company that I purchased an expensive product from treating me like a child.",5,2019-04-27 00:00:00.000
"Luthersman","Almost perfect, but the best around.","Almost perfect portable projector. The battery life is great, the speaker is good, the brightness is unexpectedly good, and the android OS works well and streams nicely. It can't compare to a full size 1080p projector with 2000-3000 lumens, it is the perfect portable solution. watch a movie or show on any wall or ceiling in the house. You don't have to worry about battery life because it is over 4 hours of play. My daughter can't wait to invite a friend over and watch a movie on her wall at 80"". I put it on the dinner table and at 30""-40"" with the lights on we now have a tv in the kitchen. where ever you go if you have a spot on the wall you could have a smart tv.Playing MKV files with the adapter works great. With  Kodi installed you can play almost everything .The speaker is good, but not amazing. For casual streaming or light music it is great. With speakers size matters.it won't give you that epic sound with big base it is the size of a soda can. The remote is great, but is ir with the receiver on the back so it can be annoying. The remote control app is good. HDMI output works nicely. I hooked it up to my note 8 and Ipad, both worked great.wish list for the next model.1. Make it the size of the echo for even better sound.2. 2 full usb slots and a micro sd card3. 720p  or 1080p4. Android TV OS5. bluetooth remote6. bigger batteryThe projector is almost perfect, but might be the best on the market.UPDATE: I have now taken this little projector everywhere. with a flexible tripod you can put this little projector almost everywhere. I've Watched movies and shows on the ceiling and wall. I Bought a piece of white black out cloth that I use as a screen which works great. with such a portable projector a portable screen is a must. I drape it mine objects or use blue painters tap to hang it on the wall (hillbilly yes, but effective). The nebula capsule has become a must for any trip. I would be interested in trying the Nabula mars II to see how it compares, but the small form factor is great and l love this projector",5,2018-04-14 00:00:00.000
"Quy T.","Best balance of image quality, audio quality and price","Received this as a gift and it has been fantastic.  Super portable with just the right amount of specs.  This thing is literally the size and weight of a soda can.  Image and audio quality is not top of the line, but for what you get in such a small package, it's perfect.  In a dark room, images are crisp and pleasing.  Even in a dimly lit room, images were clear enough to see.  Some powerpoint presentations may look washed out, but it depends on what you are presenting.  For movies, its good enough.  Audio is good, but doesn't have quite the range that would satisfy audiophiles.  Connect it to a bluetooth speaker though and you've got a great portable multimedia setup.  Customer service is top notch.  There was something wrong with the remote that I received and they sent out a new one immediately.  They also sent the code to update the firmware so that Google Play Services now runs off the device.  Sweet!  All in all, this device meets all of my needs, and I would suspect it would meet the needs of most people out there.",5,2019-02-02 00:00:00.000
"jimmy","Great portable gadget!","This was my 3rd pico projector bought and tested, and by far the best out of the 3. Easy to set up, great remote App, works great with my android, quality for the output, is quite decent (again for a portable pico). After loving this gadget, I realized I needed more of a at home/portable projector. so I returned the capsule, for the Mars II better for our family needs. again nothing wrong with the capsule, just depends on your personal needs are. for example if you need this for work/portability to project charts etc. Than get the capsule. for home (mainly) than get the Mars II. either way, both are great products, and a big plus the customer service very impressive and professional.",5,2018-08-27 00:00:00.000
"Charlie Scudder","After battery issues, great customer service","Picture, sound and OS work great. You're able to download apps like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, etc.I got this as a birthday gift last year, and had issues with keeping a battery charge -- even when plugged in. This spring, it stopped working entirely and wouldn't power on or charge. When I reached out to Nebula support, the response was quick, professional and easy. The warranty worked just as it should, no haggling about what the issue was -- just a simple replacement shipped within a few days after I mailed the defective projector back.The new one works even better than I'd hoped. Keeps battery charge for several hours, works great as a Bluetooth speaker and as a projector for indoor or outdoor movie nights. Especially during the pandemic, this has been a great day to have socially-distanced backyard get-togethers with friends and family.",5,2021-04-08 00:00:00.000
"Darren Tamonte","Great quality for the price.","I am a projector guy and Ive read some of the 2 and 1 star reviews and those people sound like they are not tech savy. Picked this up on Prime Day for $250. It's only been a day so we shall see if I need to update my review later, but right out of the box, it seemed well presented. Everything was there and more. I tested all the features and everything works as claimed. Picture quality is great, granted this is not an expensive projector. The people complaining about brightness in the day, it's the size of a soda can, what do you expect? Its decently bright, if you plan on using it in the day time, I recommend you dont make the screen size any bigger than 40 inches. Sound is comparable to an Amazon Echo or an old drive-in movie speaker. You can bluetooth it to better speakers so no big deal. I was surprized it had an automatic keystone for up and down, but can also be done manually. Apps worked well. The app controller is wonders! Screen mirroring a bit laggy, but I would only use that for things other than watching videos. A bit sad the Youtube app doesnt let you sign into your account. If I could be precise with my rating I'd say 4.5 stars. IMO, my expectations were low, but this came through and beat my expectations.",5,2018-07-22 00:00:00.000
"Patent Guy","Great portable cinema","This is an amazing product. I really expected to be slightly disappointed. Instead, I was really surprised at the overall quality of this product. We will use this in our RV.  One really nice unexpected feature is the ability to download movies and programs on Netflix and Amazon prime for offline playback. We will be able to download our favorite movies and have our own cinema while off grid.Sound quality is better than I expected but not cinema quality. But it can connect to another Bluetooth speaker to create a full blown home cinema system.Overall, I’m really pleased with this purchase. Two thumbs up, way up.",5,2018-07-19 00:00:00.000
"Eduardo Mackenzie","Excelente producto!!!","Ya lo tengo un año y funciona perfecto, las características que ofrece por el precio supera a la competencia, el sonido es muy bueno para una sala pequeña o dormitorio, el ventilador casi no hace ruido, al menos a mi no me molesta en lo absoluto, lo uso con una pantalla de 60"" y calidad del video es buena (obvio su resolución no es muy alta pero se ve bien), eso si necesita estar oscuro para verse bien, por su tamaño lo puedes llevar fácilmente a todos lados, la batería me dura unas 3 1/2 hrs y suelo conectarlo con un jbl clip 3 cuando quiero ver algún concierto, el control remoto es lo único que no me gusta, pero instalé la app en el celular y listo, hace unos días me contacté con el servicio al cliente (responden muy rápido) y les pregunté si había manera de instalar la store de google para no usar apptoide que viene por default, y me enviaron un código para instalar un beta del nuevo firmware y funcionó perfecto ahora ya tengo la app de youtube con mi cuenta y puedo actualizar las apps de inmediato (eso era un problema de apptoide que encuentras casi todas las apps pero no están las ultimas versiones).",5,2019-08-01 00:00:00.000

Netflix and Amazon and what is this other stuff. THAT'S IT?!Well thanks to reading reviews from another Amazon purchasers I learned how to unlock the power of this product.The review was spot on! Got Google play store, mirrored my phone and even called the support line, Anker (800-988-7973 PST)and spoke with Kevin. Kevin walked me through the install for Google play store. I can get email from all the major outlets and watch anything I have downloaded to my phone. (Starting to ramble on).So here is the bottom line.

Although it is capable of projecting a 100inch image, I have it on an 80 inch screen and find it to be a bit sharper.  Best part about it is that it can fit in my pocket, and when asked if I have a rocket in my pocket, I can proudly say I got a 100 inch TV in there!  Take a peek!",5,2018-07-24 00:00:00.000

I keep it simple though, and only use it for Netflix, Amazon Prime and the HDMI connection.  I would buy this for work, but some of the HDMI cables are stiff enough, that when used with a laptop, it will move the projector.  Great size for family mobile use on a variety of walls.

The room doesn’t have to be completely dark and you still get a great picture even just on white wall without a screen. It’s pretty easy to set up. Customer service is responsive if you need them. You can download Netflix and Hulu movies and watch movies offline (for example outside) so you don’t have to be on WiFi. The Aptiode app that you have to use to access Netflix/Hulu is clunky but usable. I tried using airplay to mirror Zoom dance classes but there is a slight delay. Still have not gotten it to mirror my laptop using the hdmi but haven’t gone through trouble shooting with Cust service yet.",5,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000

The surround sound is amazing, Picture quality is on point, and most of all outstanding. The remote is very good slim and easy for storage and the projector also comes with a plug-in USB port. One thing to note about the projector is it may not be up to date on apps it may require an update but once updated it is good to go. Overall i am thrilled with this product.

"krossover","Great Product...amazing customer service.","Great little product for the price point with excellent customer service. I’m new to the world of projectors and wanted one that was compact that I could take on the go without breaking the bank.  A projector that could support AirPlay was a must. Having done exhaustive research, the Nebula Capsule checked all the boxes and I’m very please with the purchase so far. Very good picture quality for a portable compact projector.  The room does need to be very dark to get the most out of this projector which I assume is to be expected for this price point and size(I’ve seen $3000+ projectors struggle with lighting conditions for comparison).The built in audio speaker does the job when on the go but I like to link my portable Bluetooth speaker to maximize the audio experience.There are some streaming limitations with airplay due to DRM copyright restrictions certain apps like Netflix or Disney+ won’t work which is a bummer if your traveling and not tapped into a WiFi network.Solution to circumvent this is to buy the $50 Apple HDMI adaptor which works like a charm for connecting your phone to the Capsule. (Do not purchase the after market adaptors as you will still face the DRM restriction).Customer Service: The customer service I received from Nebula Support Team(shout out to Ada and Wendy) was next level. They went above and beyond all expectations I had by regularly following up with me to ensure I was satisfied. In my research I found out you can request Google Play firmware for an enhanced experience which they were able to fullfill as well as helping me install Disney+ given it had just launched. They made it a point to check in with me along the process to ensure I was up and running without issue.This product coupled with the customer experience received has sparked a new found interest in exploring Anker products for my electronic needs.",5,2020-01-14 00:00:00.000
"sara","Excellent customer service","First time i bought the projector it didn’t work (it doesn’t turn on) so, i texted support and immediately they changed the item (it was very fast, and they make an exception because I’m out of US) Very nice persons and excellent customer service 💛  the new projector works perfectly!! i won’t buy tv’s anymore only anker pryectors 🤞🏼",5,2021-05-09 00:00:00.000

"Amazon Customer","SO SO GOOD.","Listen: I usually skip this whole review process out of sheer laziness but, this projector has brought me out of my shell! Please pay attention to these words very carefully.... THIS IS THE BEST PROJECTOR I HAVE EVER OWNED. I’ve owned maybe 17 in my lifetime and this one is by far the best. It’s so small yet more powerful than my larger ones. Very descreet, yet the 360 speaker volume is tremendous and it fills up the entire room with what appears to be surround sound. It’s so easy to use and is truly a portable soda can smart tv. So freaking good! Order now. Any bad reviews I’d treat with great incredulousness. This is the real deal.",5,2018-04-09 00:00:00.000

"Amazon Customer","#Yep","We were stoked to get this and upon unboxing got very discouraged it wasn’t going to do what we wanted it to do. It wasn’t until we went through 2 updates of the software that all of a sudden it clicked! We got Disney+, Netflix and Amazon connected with relative ease. We put on Moana in the backyard for the kids and neighborhood kids and they were all entranced. Our kids asked the next morning if they could “watch a movie on the wall” 😂 The brightness at night/dusk, was great but you wouldn’t be able to see it during the day. The in app remote was much easier to use than the physical one provided. Overall, we’re very happy with this purchase and can’t wait to use it while camping! We will end up getting the recommended Apple cable to connect our phones to it though so we can watch movies and shows offline",5,2021-06-05 00:00:00.000
"Amazon Customer","a really wonderful mini projector","This is the 3rd one I bought this month. I can't be happier with it.The material is so good, just like an Apple product. It's perfect, very stylish.Picture is clear, color is correct (same as on my iPhone). Noise is low. I have watched a 2 hour movie, still has battery.Very convenient to use.The only thing I'm not happy is there is a small piece of plastic to insulate the battery, geez, it took me 10 minutes to take it out. It's actually got stuck to the battery.",5,2018-12-10 00:00:00.000
"Amazon Customer","For what it is, it's amazing","I wavered between high quality and ease of use. I'm so glad I went with the capsule. I have an Optima HD that has all the awesomeness resolution and brightness. But our home doesn't have a dedicated screen space and the Nebula kicks the Optima's but in portability. It's small, it's wireless, it's streams directly from itself. It's awesome and I haven't used the Optima since we've bought this little thing.I toyed with the idea of spending double to get the new version. I just couldn't justify the cost. For the price, the first edition is perfect.",5,2019-06-07 00:00:00.000
"Amazon Customer","So fun and easy to use!","This projector is the best, completely worth the money! We bought a different one here on Amazon that was cheaper and ended up returning it, just start with a good quality one like this. The picture quality is great and it’s so simple to use. There is an app that allows you to use your phone like a mouse on the screen and it easily connects to Bluetooth headphones.",5,2020-11-09 00:00:00.000

"Amazon Customer","Powerful, yet in a small package","Totally exceeded my expectation! Brightness is awesome, you can see projection clearly even in a lit room. Connects to both my iPad and android tablets super quickly. Image correction makes sure that I don't need to tweak too much for rectangle projection. You will have some fan noise, but with speaker playing sounds it's barely noticeable. Chargeable with a power bank. Also, the support staff was super responsive, friendly and knowledgable! This is one very powerful projector jammed into a can-sized form factor. Only downside so far is that the remote only works when pointed towards the back 180 degrees of the unit. Overall strongly recommended!",5,2019-05-10 00:00:00.000
"Amazon Customer","Great device. Super handy.","This thing is great. Small, good battery life, good app, and good picture quality. The device itself feels solid and well made. Well worth the money. My only complaint/suggestion to Anker is the round design makes it hard to prop up. Maybe use a hexagon/pentagon or something with sides. I got around this by sticking a Scosche metal plate to the bottom and mounting a Scosche dash mount to the plastic container I store my Nebula in. I can then just stick the Nebula onto the magnet mount and it holds it well enough to angle it however needed.",5,2018-09-27 00:00:00.000
"Amazon Customer","Love it","I love this thing.  I've taken it out backpacking to watch a movie at night in my tent. It's awesome, I download stuff off Netflix and it works great.  Battery life does great but I still bring an external.  I use my cellphone as a mouse to guide through the device.  I tried the touchscreen android projectors but I've had to return them because they won't download or update certain TV apps. This has not been an issue with this projector.  The image is excellent and it gets very large.  Can fill up a wall and so look great.  Epic Device!",5,2020-08-29 00:00:00.000

"Amazon Customer","Perfect","This projector is completely cordless and amazing! I was looking for a projector that I could take camping without worrying about a mess of cords that would get in the way, and this is it! The fan is super silent and non noticeable and the projector is able to play at a decently loud volume if necessary! Super easy to set up and use. The battery life is exactly 4 hours so you can watch whatever movie you want and it charges incredibly fast! The picture and overall quality is amazing and I would 10/10 definitely recommend!",5,2021-04-12 00:00:00.000
"Amazon Customer","Great projector for its size.","I was impressed with the overall performance of this projector.Image quality is not HD as specified but it is clear enough to enjoy the content you play.Sound quality is not great but the speaker is loudly enough even to play it outside. I have played movies outside with a crowd of 20 people and everyone was able to hear pleasantly.Brightness is very good even in rooms with lights on, for a screen size up to around 50-60 inches.The software needs a little optimization for the app and airplay but it does work and very well once you set it up.I got it with the black Friday deal ($235.99) and it is worth the money.",5,2018-12-12 00:00:00.000
"Amazon Customer","Outstanding product.  Great quality.","This product is amazing.  We enjoy this as a family every night since we’ve gotten it.  We watch Netflix  for movies on the ceiling or wall.  It’s So fun. There are so many options and it brings us all together.",5,2021-01-14 00:00:00.000
"Amazon Customer","Best Customer Service Ever!","I just got the device today so I'm learning how to use it. Long story short I couldn't just plug and play what I wanted so I used the free Capsule app to chat with customer service. Ashley immediately responded to me through the chat feature. When she realized what I wanted was a bit more complicated she called me in 30 secs. Ashley stayed on the phone with me until I we got the device to do what I needed. I can honestly say it's the best customer service experience I ever had with an electronic device. As of now the company gets an A++ from me.  Thanks Ashley!",5,2018-09-18 00:00:00.000

It’s so efficient to use especially with the phone app as a remote control. You can charge it while using it.I will say that the only thing I wish it was better at was the ability to type your search without any glitches for YouTube searches.Other than that it works so seamlessly. I’ve already had other friends purchase while enjoying it at my place. It has a great quality of picture even if you have some lights on at night.

"Eric in New Mexico","Compared to the WOWOTO T8e, Nebula made a great set of compromises on a truly portable device","After comparison to the WOWOTO T8E: Bumping up one star.  I wish I could settle at say, 3.75 stars.  I really want a bit more ANSI lumens (200 would be solid); and 720P.  But Anker/Nebula clearly balanced a lot of choices in the design here.  Internal apps also need work, and we need Google Play Services stat.  I also think Netflix needs a tweak to support higher resolution streaming as it seems to settle on 480p and lower bitrate than I'd like and I find connecting my phone via HDMI results in a better Netflix experience.Overall I'm sticking with the Nebula Capsule over the T8e.  My reasons being:1) Fan noise on the T8e is way too annoying2) T8e has a terrible internal speaker, and using a BT speaker is a huge problem because of a .5s-1s audio delay3) No smartphone app for control - this is the the best part of the Nebula Capsule as the smartphone app is excellent.  I hated using the touchpad on the top of the T8e.4) <2 hours Battery life on the T8e means you will likely always need to plug in during a full length movie.5) While the T8e is fairly portable - it's not ""toss in the pocket/bag"" portable - and I certainly wouldn't count on the battery of the T8e to last long enoughThe T8e certainly provided a sharper, brighter, and overall better image - but also I found colors overly saturated and red.  I'm debating the WOWOTO H8 for a permanent setup and sticking with the capsule for portable needs.  The bottom line is that if you don't need a BATTERY powered portable device with a very capable internal speaker, there are better choices than the Nebula for image quality.  Anker/Nebula clearly focused on a truly capable stand-alone/no wires attached experience that can last well past a single full-length movie and provide a decent enough speaker to make sure a crowd can hear.  The addition of solid connectivity, and bluetooth that is lag free are huge capabilities.  And let's be straightforward, the fact it runs Android 7.0 already is a huge advantage to app updates moving forward.  A lot of companies (like WOWOTO) say they will upgrade, but I wouldn't hold your breath.I'm deducting 1 star in order to bring attention to an issue with Netflix.  I've noticed that Netflix seems to cap resolution/bitrate to a pretty low level when using the built in app on the Capsule.  I see lots of pixelation and compression artifacts that make the image quality severely reduced.  When I plug in an HDMI stream of the same movie/show on Netflix, the image is decidedly sharper with no compression artifacts and noticeable higher bitrate.  I've checked the youtube settings - but nothing in there other than for ""high"" quality downloads.  I'm really loving this toy, but find the built apps really lack across the board and often have to plug in something to HDMI to improve the situation.",4,2018-01-26 00:00:00.000
"Andrew Smith","Very Satisified","When I first saw the Nebula Capsule, I knew I had to own one. All the specs seemed to be sufficient, so I figured I would give it a go. If you plan to use this to project on your ceiling, I suggest buying the tripod. Especially if you are using the HDMI from another device as your input source.Pros:Battery Life - This is sufficient for a long movie and additional usage. Along with being able to charge and play movies, even better!Picture Quality - For not having a dedicated screen, projecting on white walls have been fantastic. The quality isn't anything super HD, but it also isn't advertised as such.Built-In Android - I'm an iPhone person, so I wasn't sure what to expect out of the built in Android. The apps install and update very easily. Some of the apps don't function properly, but this could be due to the app creator and not the Nebula Capsule.Speaker - Sufficient for most areas, but you may need to use an external Bluetooth speaker depending on the ambient noise around you.Fan Noise - I had read some reviews that said the fan was loud, but my experience has been quite the opposite. Mine is very low and isn't noticeable.Cons:Lens - I would like to see a shutter or protector for the lens for when it's not in use.Apps - You can't sign into certain apps with the built in version of Android.Screen Mirroring - The screen mirroring from the iPhone is accomplished easy enough, but with some apps there seems to be a very noticeable delay. This being said, using the Apple lightning to HDMI adapter to the projector works great.",4,2018-04-20 00:00:00.000
"MW","From a filmmakers perspective.","What I love about this thing is that it brings the simple joy of movies and story’s back in a way that reminds me of when I was young. The ability to take a movie with you camping or at grandmas house, it’s just fun. It’s as small and cool as it seems.The bad. For my taste, I dont love the resolution. At 8 feet away I just found it a bit soft. More than that though, and this is something I’m not seeing many talk about, the frame rate seems to be lousy so a lot of shots were jerky or choppy, especially those big, sweeping landscape shots that are supposed to feel epic. Chop chop chop. Brightness is fine but treat it like a theater and turn off all the lights. I’d love 2-300 limes but it’s a coke can so I can’t complain.The software is “fine.”  Figure out how to get most of what you want through amazon or Netflix.Here’s the biggest takeaway. If you want a great picture, get the bigger one. If you want a fun little surprise you can toss in your bag and then surprise your family with. Something where you can sit around and just enjoy a good story, it’s terrific.That being said I’d happily spend $1-200 more on a new one if it had more punch.",4,2018-07-25 00:00:00.000
"Stephanie Zahn","Great now that I have google play!","We had a rough beginning but I finally love it! I could not for the life of me get my note 9 to screencast, without a 3rd party app called ""castto"". The problem is, it froze so much. I use this to stream peloton workouts so it was super frustrating when it would freeze for a good 2-3 minutes, multiple times, during workouts. I was not sure if it was the casting app or the Nebula that was freezing. I finally got around to calling Nebula, to get the password to install google play, so I could just download the app I wanted instead of screen casting. Like the other reviewer said, to get google play you need to: Go to ABOUT in the settings menu and CLICK ON THE ANDROID VERSION 5 TIMES in a row. A password window comes up, input gmstest1221 (all lower case, no spaces) then click DONE and it'll let you install. The device will need to reboot.After I got google play, I took my workout class and experienced NO freezing. So it seems to be the casting app I was using. Nebula really should consider selling the device with google play already installed.The sound is GREAT imo but the remote sucks and is highly frustrating.  I love that this projector is so small. Easily portable. I do think it's too expensive for what it is.",4,2019-12-27 00:00:00.000
"Dino Biel","Wanted to love it, but it wouldn't love me...","I wanted to give this more stars, but it just falls short... I am sending this back because the unit I received has a defect, but I did test it (at least the features that were working) and here is what I got to say:Pros:---------------- Runs cool to the touch (Every time i turned it on it never got hot)- Feels really well built- Projector works well- Built in speaker holds its own....not better than most portable speakers but still a good speaker.Cons:------------------ Let's start with the biggest: The OS is buggy.... and I couldn't even successfully download apps from the store. Every time i tried it crashed.- This device is severely lacking inputs. Other models out there have more inputs- The remote control is absurdly finicky, you have to aim it right behind the projector and if you don't your input wont register....- No Google Play Store?!?!??! Why?!??!?! (to be fair they include Aptoide TV but it's a far cry from the play store).Conclusion: I really wanted to love this product. But after not being able to download apps because of crashing, I did a factory reset, and same problem kept occurring. Thinking it may have been an internet issue I tried to use it from a different Wifi and still no good. Unfortunately because mine wouldn't let me download apps I had to test it other ways (via HDMI).I know what you're thinking It sounds like I hate it, so why 3 stars? Well when it did work the projector was really good for the price. I am sure my unit was just defective, and if it did work I would have probably given it 4 stars. There are other reviews out there that talk about the OS....read them.... I should have paid more attention prior to purchase.UPDATE:Bumped 1 star because of customer service. Anker Customer service reached out to me and tried to make things right, however I had already returned the device. They had offered to replace my device with a brand new device at no charge. It was a really kind gesture and I think it was really cool that they reached out to me to try to make it right.",4,2018-05-25 00:00:00.000
"joe cabello","Tested in home and outdoors for groups","I've used this to screen outdoor movies and it was plenty bright with good picture. You can get better picture quality from cheaper projectors, but the convenience factor is just too good. I went from watching a movie in on room to the other with no set up needed.  I just moved my tripod from one room to the other. If it wasn't so convenient, I'd never use it. Since it is, I use it constantly.The included software does the job, though some apps require you to use your phone as a remote.If the price is egregious to you but you still want portability, I would suggest investing in a cheaper projector but also get a stand and a mount. You're probably looking at spending about the same at that point.Cons:Sound - the speakers are loud enough, but they are tinny. It does NOT have aux hook up, so you'll have to rely on Bluetooth. I found there to be some lag with the bluetooth though. There is a way around this. Instead of connecting to the projector to the bluetooth speaker, connect the DEVICE to the bluetooth speaker.Example, watching a movie through your laptop via the HDMI cable - have the laptop connect to the bluetooth speaker. You won't get lag that way.Overall:Biggest complaint is lack of Aux cable. Other than that, this has been an incredibly smooth and easy product to use. Even at $300, I'm happy with it.",4,2020-06-22 00:00:00.000
"SE Gleason","Didn't Work with iPhone (updated)","We returned the item as it didn't work as we expected.  You can't set the system up without a phone app even though it looks like there are controls for it on the device.  The iPhone app interface is clumsy and the touch control doesn't work well.  The UI screen flow is incomprehensible.  We couldn't get the iPhone display to project and when we tried to download the device's Netflix, etc. apps to project shows that way; the installs always failed with ""Unexpected error"".  It even took quite a bit of playing to get the PC display to project.  I probably could have played with it, bought more cables and gotten everything to eventually work but this was a present for someone who is not technically savvy and gets frustrated getting techy stuff to work.  I've been in IT for decades and everything about the projector setup and operation felt like it was designed by a techie for a techies and not for a consumer.  When we did get a projected display, the display was OK.(update)  Anker contacted me about my review and the returned item.  They apologized for my experience with their product and sent a bluetooth speaker to me by way of compensation (I had already received a full refund).  I am impressed with the customer service response and appreciate the gesture so I've changed the rating from 2 to 4 stars though I guess that should really apply to the seller not the product.  Still, a company that reaches out to its unhappy customers deserves some credit.",4,2021-01-09 00:00:00.000
"Amazon_Shop_3920777","Nice hardware design but user experience is terrible","Bought this for it's portability and ease of use through WiFi and streaming applications. Was easy to set-up and the quality is good. However, the negative outweighs the positive for me. When streaming, it goes to sleep every 30 min or so. I have to remember to move the mouse which ruins the experience. If there's a setting to change this, I can't find it in all the menus I've sorted through. Searched online for a solution and nothing was helpful. Just opening a show on Netflix is a nightmare. Even using the Nebula Connect app is painful for scrolling. Usually need to close out the Netflix app completely and open it again. Would not recommend this.UPDATE: Anker customer support is really superb. They followed up to ensure my software and firmware were up to date to resolve my issue. The sleeping issue no longer happens, but I’m still experiencing some minor glitches. I’ve revised my rating to a 4.",4,2019-05-01 00:00:00.000
"Texi","Amazing concept that could use a little tweaking","Our family decided to put on an outdoor movie in the backyard, so I started looking at buying a projector. I quickly realized we were going to need a lot of cords/connections to make it work. And then I ran across this handy product.Pros:- No extension cords needed, no connecting to a receiver/laptop for media content, and speakers already built in... AMAZING!! Plus, controlling it all from my own phone (or the provided remote if I want).- Has apps for streaming content, which basically makes it a portable smart TV- The speakers are great for most use, but for an outdoor movie with lots of people, we decided to connect it via bluetooth to our Sonos Move speaker. Brilliant built-in option, and again, no cords needed.- Setup was extremely easy.- Auto keystone correction feature is really handy. It senses the angle of tilt and adjusts the picture to match, so you don't end up with a weird trapezoid shape.- Has screw in feature at the bottom for a standard tripod.Cons:- Noticeably dim. This was the biggest disappointment for me. Even when it was completely dark outside and we were using a proper movie screen, I felt like the movie picture was just a little dark. There is an option in the settings to adjust to ""max brightness"", but it can only support 1.5 hrs of playtime, which makes it impractical for most movies.- No way to adjust tilt angle of the projection without physically moving the whole thing (or using a tripod). Not that this is usually an issue, but we tried once to project it on a slanted ceiling, and there was just no way to prop it up to the right angle to aim it at the ceiling without kind of leaning it against a pillow.- Downloading Google Play services is a pain. As others have said, you have to contact customer service and jump through some extra hoops to access this content. I wanted to watch Youtube TV app on it and it would not work until I ran the extra update they required.- Sometimes the provided remote does not work. Still can't figure out why.Overall we like it and hope to see some improvements in the next edition. If nothing else, it really impressed our friends. :)",4,2020-03-24 00:00:00.000
"GetOutside2121","Great little projector","I bought this projector to use when camping and also for the occasional time when we want to watch TV in our bedroom (which does not have a TV). I have watched about 20 hours of content on this device so far, so feel like I am in a position to give it a fair review.Picture quality: Is excellent, as long as you are using it in the dark.Sound: Shockingly good for a device this small. As good as bluetooth speakers I have that cost 2x as much.Software: The one drawback, I've found, is the native software installed on this puppy. It is buggy and it certain streaming services are not available. We use it with a Roku attached to the HDMI port, and I'd say be prepared to connect an external device if you buy. I have had some luck mirroring my iphone but this is not a perfect solution as all content cannot be mirrored.In all, this is an excellent device for the price. It is not a replacement for a TV and could have better native software, but I'd still recommend it if you have an occasion for a pocket-sized projector.",4,2019-10-25 00:00:00.000
"TheChinaman","Works well, but has flaws","I really like this portable projector.PROS:It can display a large ""screen"".The sound is adequate for viewing.It's tiny.It has good battery life.HDMI input works with my Chromecast.CONS:Focus adjustment does not make easy fine adjustments.Does not use Google Play. App updates are iffy.Remote is IR not Bluetooth.  You have to point it at the sensor on the back.Not all apps support the inherent controls.Needs to be dark to see. I hear the newer version is brighter.",4,2019-01-24 00:00:00.000
"jairo steve carrero","It's so small and it does so much!","It's loud, the fans, if you are in a small room and have it replacing your tv. It sparks conversation among friends as it it super small and can expand so much and still look super clear. It could be brighter but hey it already does a LOT for its size. Sometimes on videos that are too saturated it will lag, like the ones from Kurzgesagt.... for some reason his videos always freeze and I'm not kidding. I never got it to connect to the air play or smart view, I had to get me an external hdmi smart view adaptor to make it work as such. You won't be able to turn a party with the speaker as it lacks base and loudness; however it works good on a small room to watch a movie. Overall if you want to get one for on the go and to surprise family and friends at parties this is your gadget. If you want something professional or robust they offer more options.",4,2021-01-07 00:00:00.000
"J. Lee","Decent product","Update: this company really cares about their products and their service. From all my amazon experiences this company has one of the best customer service to address the problem you are facing at hand; hence I added one more star.For whopping 300 dollars not convinced whether this was all worth it. First the best feature: SPEAKERS. Honestly I don’t feel the need to attach any external speakers. Second best: Battery life. It’s pretty awesome you can watch a whole movie or two without having to worry about recharging. Everything else is nothing impressive; the light is pretty low, can’t see much as long as the sun is still hangs low in the sky, resolution is low that you can see the individual pixels at just about 30+ inches screen size(I cannot imagine the low quality it being projected for 50in). Design is cute and it is very portable. My return window closed while debating and I guess I am ok keeping it but not thrilled, hence 3 stars.",4,2020-07-16 00:00:00.000
"J. R. Knutson","Anker Customer Support is THE BEST","My first Capsule died unexpectedly and for no apparent reason. The return and replacement was simple, straight forward, and quick. I encountered and odd problem with the Capsule that ""was NOT the fault of the Capsule."" There is a software app (Nebula Connect) that is necessary to use certain Capsule features (like: YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video) and the app worked perfectly with my wife's Pixel 4A but would not work on my Pixel 4. Anker Customer Support spent several days debugging the issue and stuck with me until the problem was solved. Anker Customer Support provided some of the best customer support I have ever received.",4,2020-11-22 00:00:00.000
"M Schmick","Love this little thing! Unbelievable value for what you get.","Set the bar the right height and you will love this thing. It's only 480p, yes.I will remind you that a few years ago that was high end DVD progressive scan quality! Inside of a projector the size of a coke can that also works off of a battery as well?! AND it will stream via Wifi and connect to Plex, Netflix, Hulu etc? Are you kidding me?Incredible value. Being in the Audio Visual industry I was skeptical and expected this thing to be going back after I played with it for a few hours. Pleasantly surprised. Keeping this little guy. Have used in bedroom and in the back yard and been happy. good stuff.",4,2020-06-18 00:00:00.000
"NeitLife Adventures","Excellent little piece of hardware with serious software flaws","We’ve been talking ourselves out of returning this in favor of a cheaper option but the convenience is just so worth it. It’s tiny, it comes with decent sound (think mid-range Bluetooth speaker), and it can run without cables.The downsides are there. I gave up on the onboard apps. The remote doesn’t work with any streaming service and requires you to use the Nebula app. And even then, you have to change it to “mouse mode” in order to make it work. Highly recommend connecting it to an Apple TV or hooking up a fire stick to keep the bulk down.That being said, I connected the Xbox and ran with that.Automatic keystone adjustment is hit or miss. In ideal settings I’m sure it works well. But on an RV it’s basically point it and the brightest surface in the room you’re in so it’s hard to get the keystone levels dialed in. Eventually you accept it the way it is. So, the portability makes it worth it. The tiny fan sounds like static so it can be a little annoying if it’s close to you.",4,2020-10-24 00:00:00.000
"Voodoo Daddy-O","Great little projector, and it really is about the size of a soda can","This isn't the projector you'd want for a permanent home theater, but it's perfect for watching movies in the backyard or some other fun special occasion. The image isn't really HD, and it isn't especially bright, but in a dark room, it's great; the closer it is to the screen, the brighter the image, but we watched Endgame on a 100"" screen the other night, and it was fine. It comes with a handful of streaming apps, including Amazon Prime Video and some other big ones, so you don't have to connect to a laptop or Blu-ray player to watch movies. The built-in speaker is fine -- not spectacular, but definitely good enough. And it really is about the size of a soda can, and, so far, the battery has lasted me about 4 hours per charge, which is plenty of time to watch most movies. I also like the automatic keystoning; the software automatically adjusts and squares up the image, so the top isn't bigger than the bottom. The remote is fine, it works, but some streaming apps work best if you download the Nebula app onto your phone and use it, instead. Plus, there's a thing in the bottom, so you can screw it into a tripod, which is nice. Also, I had no trouble connecting it to my home WiFi. TL;DR: A great little projector that's really all you need to have movie night.",4,
"Jess L","Small, convenient projector! Awesome for bedroom setting","We bought this with the plan to use it in our bedroom without the need to install a wall mounted platform or having cables around the bed. This small projector works perfectly the way we wanted it to be. It's small with a loud speaker, and the image quality is great on our wall (light grey in color). We are using it on a small laptop desk on our bed and we can enjoy the shows all night. We see ourselves using it at our patio or the living room as well.There were compatibility issues with Amazon Prime Videos and Peacock TV at the begin, but all were resolved very quickly after contacting the technical staff at Nebula. They were very responsive and helpful. This projector, at this moment, does not support HD viewing on Netflix though (a block from Netflix' side). So now we are watching Netflix with our regular TV, which is fine. We are very happy with our purchase!",4,2020-12-03 00:00:00.000
"Christian Lenoir","My first experience was not good but my second attempt worked well","5/22 update: I am updating to 4 stars based on the stellar customer support received after my first experience. Upon initially returning the nebula, Anker reached out asking about my experience. Long story short, I agreed to give them a second chance as it seems the nebula I had initially received was defective. Anker agreed to honor the “deal of the day” price of my initial purchase and work with me to get me a replacement before upcoming travel. I received the new nebula today and this time setup went as expected. While it is still early to say, so far I am happy with how the device is working.———I am puzzled about all the good reviews. Maybe I just got the lemon. I connected everything according to instructions from an iPhone 7+. Upon setting up wifi and bluetooth, and downloading the app, everything was sync'd fine. However, when opening the apps (youtube, amazon, netflix) I consistently got a network error message. I tried projecting from HDMI and got an error saying no hdmi signal. I tried rebooting, and recovering to no avail. Bottom line: I was never able to project anything.  This should be an easy out of the box setup experience for a new phone like an iPhone 7+. Not sure if this is an incompatibility between their Android system or what--I am very frustrated and sending back for a refund.",4,2019-05-18 00:00:00.000
"Lanie Rose Baltch","My family loves it!","First of all, this thing is small! Compared to the other projectors I’ve seen. It’s the size of a soda can. My guests would get so amaze whe they see it. How convenient! So easy to store and put away and bring along. We use it for outdoor movie night in our backyard and in my kids’ room for a tv night before bed. We just project the shows/movie on their wall while they watch it on their bed. The picture quality is great. The reason for only 4 stars is it’s not loud enough for outdoor movie night. I have a big backyard and I project the movie to our fence. So it’s not loud enough when outside in a big space. But it is loud enough indoors. But overall I’m very happy with this projector!",4,2020-12-06 00:00:00.000
"SR5K","Easy to set up, plug and play.","This is a great, little and extremely portable projector to use.  It was plug and play using my eye phone.  I didn’t have to fiddle with any settings.  I used an HDMI cable into the projector as recommended in the instruction sheet to an HDMI to iPhone connector.  Very easy.  The picture quality was very good.  The only thing to be aware of is to achieve the best picture quality you really need it to be dark.  I used the projector outside at night and had great results.  I tried again at sunset and had to wait until the sun went down and it got dark.  It doesn’t come with a remote but you can focus using the built in focus dial.  For the price, the size and its capability it an amazing little projector.  The internal speaker is very good, but keep in mind it’s not going to produce Dolby digital sound.  Given the limitation of needing to be dark it’s a great value, very to easy set up, plug and play and allowed me to entertain a group of campers with movies from my iPhone in the evening.",4,2019-08-16 00:00:00.000
"DJ Martinez","Great little projector that gives an enjoyable experience.","This little projector I bought about 2 or 3 years ago and still going strong. The brightness is good for a dark room and very dimly lit room. Personally the brightness was not to bad because I enjoy a darker ambience. Battery life is about 3-5 hours for me depending on the lighting mode you choose. There are three modes. Auto, Bright and Balanced. Bright is great for brighter lit rooms and balance will definitely extend your battery life. Only con for me is the remote being Infrared and the sensor being on the back of the Capsule. A bluetooth air-mouse or touchpad remote would have been a lot more useful removing the restrictions of the IR. The workaround which definitely resolves the issue it the Nebula app that allows you to use your phone as a remote. This is the saving grace for me to navigate the interface.",4,2020-06-05 00:00:00.000
"Talyssa","Very portable and easy to use","This product is very portable and easy to use. The remote control leaves a lot to be desired but at least it works. When mine arrived the remote was cracked and didn't work. Thankfully, Evans from customer support was about to get me a replacement as well as getting me the code so that I could install Google Play. Google play makes all the difference with this projector, it is an absolutely must! I do wish it had an auto focus option.::edit:: the remote is terrible and makes navigating this device almost impossible if you dont have the phone app.... which shouldn't be the case. The remote that comes with it should be able to work with the device",4,2020-11-01 00:00:00.000
"Josh","Great projector for inside use, not so great outside.","If you’re going to use this model in a dark room inside your house this is a great item. The sound is surprisingly great for 1 single speaker. However if you’re thinking of bringing it outside (even with the use of a screen) it is going to be very hard to see the picture. That is unless you live out in the boonies. I live about an hour away from any major metropolitan area/airport and it isn’t dark enough but maybe it is pitch black outside where you live it may work. Also it is not HD if you care but has a good pic quality when you focus it manually. If you have YouTube, Netflix etc you can stream direct.",4,2020-06-14 00:00:00.000
"Amy C","For an Anker product, I feel it lacks its' usual user friendliness and high performance.","I haven't had a chance to try out all it's extras but I like it so far (not in love with it though). I downloaded the phone app to use a mouse and controller but the bluetooth connection is very spotty. When it works, it's pretty handy vs the controller it comes with. The picture is a bit blurry even with the ability to adjust the clarity. I've only tried it on walls and doors not a projector screen. I do like Anker products so I am kinda disappointed with this products lack of user friendly controls and high performance but I will have to play with it a bit more to find all the little goodies it might hold. Also, I might be rating it a bit higher because I was able to buy this for a bit cheaper than it's current listed price. I brought this to try & replace a TV but I might still buy a TV in the end. Oh wells! If I find something else to report, I will update the review. Overall, I'm 50-50 about recommending it. I did read several other reviews saying there are better comparable products but being an Anker fan and for it's portability (battery life), I went with this one.",4,2018-06-13 00:00:00.000

Remote controls are always clunky for digital navigation.Overall: I like this product a lot. I find certain light, despite being the same 'brightness', makes it more difficult to see. Particularly if the scenes are already dark, it can get washed out. The darker the room, the better. Also, despite having the projector on a flat surface, there seems to be a slight tilt to the picture. Not sure if that's a device issue or not but I noted it on a couple different surfaces. But I knew what the limits were and it's an impressive little device!",4,2021-03-15 00:00:00.000
"Theodore B. Royster","Nice, portable display/projection unit with excellent quality","very good picture quality, although not 4K/HD.  I think the difference is negligible.  Brightness is a relative term.  ""How dark is your operating environment"" is the key factor.  The darker, the better.  Night time or low ambient lighting - great.  Remote control via your phone is far superior to the handheld remote supplied with the unit.  The unit is portable, light weight and easy to set up.  I often forget that I have it in my backpack.

The picture is clear and it's easy to stream off of it.* Phone mirror using app* USB for files* HDMI for DVD players.It's a solid buy and I recommend this for someone looking for a casual small group projector. This is best for solo use or with a small group of friends. As a teacher, I wouldn't recommend this for a larger size group as the picture wont be big enough and the audio isnt loud enough.The remote feels sturdy and feels like most amazon stick remotes. My issue is it only works for select things on the projector. Sometimes you are forced to use the mouse pad function on it, which is a pain.",4,2021-08-04 00:00:00.000

"SimonB","Great for what it is","You gotta appreciate what you're working with here, the size of it is literally the size of a coke can and in that you're squeezing so much, so yeah, it's not the brightest projector and will need a fairly dark room to pick up on nuances of the image, but that's fine, it does surprisingly well in average lighting, better than expected.Also, if you think of a Bluetooth speaker half the size of a coke can, yeah, it's not going to be as loud or basey but the tinny edge isn't too bad. One thing I would've liked would be the newer bluetooth specification as although this device supports linking a bluetooth speaker or headphones with better audio quality, the audio is delayed (newer bluetooth spec. accounts for this, I have it on my PC). There's also no (obvious anyway) way to delay the audio in say Youtube or Netflix so it makes the bluetooth audio pretty pointless.I used to have a no-name cheap chinese pocket projector (about the size of two phones atop each other) and this is brighter, better battery and has a speaker (the other does not) however the other had a 1.3mm audio out which is useful (especially as the bluetooth audio here isn't) and it also had a microsd card slot, which again is handy to load content and works around the limitations of the onboard memory (which is only 8GB to start with and most of that is taken by the OS and apps).Having an android OS onboard though is great and something the cheap chinese model didn't have, it just makes things so much easier having it native to the device, rather than trying to mirror netflix from my phone.All in, it's definitely been worth the upgrade from the previous model, but does have a couple of niggles I hope they work out in either an update (bluetooth spec) or future revision (ports).You can see on the image about an 100"" screen on my studio flat's wall, filling the room from the desk across it when I was in the midst of moving out, the TV and most fittings gone the day before, this was a good cover until I followed them!

I really LOVE that I can continue watching videos while charging the projector, this means I have the option to watch 24/7 as long as I have it plugged into a power source.

There's also the phone app, and you can get some more features.. the remote is usually just fineSoftware - overall: It is a trimmed down Android OS, but for most users it'll do everything you need.

"Michael","Great performance from a little projector","Was looking for a good option to use for quarantine family movie nights and this little projector has been great for the most part.  While the picture is not true HD or 4K, it’s very clear, even when it’s projected at 75 - 80” on a smooth surface (once it’s good and dark outside). We have used both a Blu-ray player and an Apple TV via the HDMI connection and both look very good. The built in apps (Netflix and Prime, for example) work well generally, but we’ve occasionally had some lag and buffering. Although I don’t use the remote or the Nebula iOS app too often, I think they could both be improved. The remote could really use a backlight for the buttons - tough to navigate in the dark. We typically set the Nebula up on top of a tripod and show it on a portable screen. The volume and sound quality from the Nebula’s speaker are more than sufficient. Overall, it’s a great option.",4,2020-08-10 00:00:00.000

The portability is fantastic, picture is really decent, sound is great for what it is. My only suggestion for manufacturers is this.  You take so much pride in the speaker and sound of this little unit as you should, however you have hobbled the capabilities by not having the capability of an audio out option for your customers. It's great that it has it's own sound and that is a selling point, but what if I want to run it through a sound bar or more capable sound machine when I'm not out and about. You are so proud of the sound that this puts out that you felt that you had to force it on consumers instead of giving more options and functionality.

"jb2001","Great for a budget projector","First and foremost, I like this product a lot for what it is: a portable budget projector that happens to run Android. But it’s not without its flaws, mainly being that the remote doesn’t work (despite following all the instructions in the manual and on their support forum) and to unlock its full potential you need to join their beta program for google services.Those two items aside, the projector is quite bright for its size and does well in a moderately dark room. The sound from the onboard speaker is what you would expect from a mobile device, so if you want better quality, you should pair it with speakers.Does this replace a full sized projector? No. But it’s great to have if you’re projecting against a wall in your home for like a movie night or some streaming.",4,2019-04-24 00:00:00.000
"Amazon Customer","Great portable speaker with all the bells and whistles.","This is a great little projector to take into many situations.  We got this mainly to replace a micro projector we were using in the kid's treehouse to watch movies.  We also use it as an additional to in the house if we need one, and we take it to share videos as part of the Sunday School class we teach.  The larger you project, the darker the room needs to be, but I think anything under about 50 inches does pretty well in a half-lit room.It's well built and the embedded Android system makes it extremely useable, but I highly recommend contacting Anker and getting the beta firmware with Google Store.  Otherwise the apps will be limited.  I couldn't sign into Vudu or Movies Anywhere until I upgraded to the beta firmware.  Now, every platform works great, and I am able to download several movies to the projector so I can watch them offline.This would be great for camping, small business meetings and everything in between.The focus wheel isn't as precise as I would like it to be, but because you can move the projector, you still get the sharpest picture possible.I really like the speaker, it's plenty loud for a good sized room.  And I also like it's completely self contained quality.  It comes with a pouch, but I bought an inexpensive case that has a slot for the charger and remote.  It's still small and compact.",4,

"Jade","Nice for the price","If you're looking for tv or movie quality image I'm not sure this your device.  The image is definitely better in a dark or in low light room.  Even so on a white wall with an overhead light on the picture isn't that bad.  I like it because it's portable.  I can use it in the bedroom or my craft room or my office.  Sound is way better than I expected.",4,2020-09-16 00:00:00.000
"MelissaB N NYC","Not a bad projector hopefully they fix the issues","The controls are a bit janky and hard to get use to. It can cast and I’ve gotten it to work for YouTube. But apps are pretty limited. I still like it for a mobile movie and tv system. And plugging my phone in is pretty simple or a laptop. But why they block casting Netflix and other apps is beyond me. If I can cast to my tv I should be able to legally cast to this or mirror.",4,
"Brooke","Great image in small package","The picture quality and brightness are great for such a small projector. The software is minimal so I have chosen to use an HDMI connection and it works as expected. We had trouble with the remote that was sent with the capsule, but customer service immediately shipped us a new remote and it worked perfectly.",4,2021-05-07 00:00:00.000
"Donald Allison","Imperfect but awesome","I love this little device! It's not perfect, but I think Nebula made the right set of tradeoffs to enable a self-contained, easily portable, and enjoyable entertainment experience.The picture is sharper and brighter than I was expecting, but my standards may be more relaxed than those of others. Is it as bright and sharp as a modern HDTV? Of course not. Will it hurt your eyes or detract from the content you are viewing? Not at all in my experience.The sound is solid - loud and good enough in quality. I'm not bowled over by it, but - again - it serves its purpose nicely.The software is okay out of the box, and made much better if you qualify to beta test a version with Google Play Services (which allows you to install apps from the Google Play Store and sign in with your Google account to, e.g., YouTube). If you buy this, I highly recommend contacting Nebula Support and asking to be a beta tester.The remote is nice but more or less useless, since apps like Netflix require the Capsule Control app, and because you have to be behind the projector for the remote to work. Thankfully, the Capsule Control app works great, and I'm thinking about repurposing an old Android phone as a dedicated remote. Navigation can be somewhat fiddly in mouse mode, but nothing unusable.It would be nice if Anker added a retractable lens cover. They do provide a bag, but it would be nice to just throw the device in an overnight bag as-is; I wouldn't do this without a lens cover though.I haven't run it down to zero, but battery life seems roughly in line with expectations. 1-2 hours of viewing has run it down to somewhere in the 60-70% range.I have not tested it with HDMI or USB content yet, only with the built-in software.Overall, I think Nebula succeeded in what they were trying to do here. There are some rough edges (software, lens cover), but none of them make me question the purchase. It does not replace a home theater setup, but, if you are buying this with the right use case in mind (portable, self-contained entertainment), you will not be disappointed!",4,2018-09-07 00:00:00.000
"Moe","Good for the price. Great support.","*Disclosure*Anker asked me to write a review after an exchange with customer support.*Disclosure*I bought the Nebula Capsule as a gift for my dad. He occasionally gives presentations in different offices and community centers and this looked like an easy way to have a consistent and reliable way to put up visual aids. The projector is surprisingly small and well built. It can be a little hard to find the best focus at first with the necessarily tiny dial, but it's pretty easy once you're used to it. The resolution is pretty good for a pico projector at this price and colors are good too. The one knock on image quality is how easily overpowered the image can be under certain lights and on certain backgrounds, but when you're working with such a small form factor it's expected.As for software, I was disappointed to see that there wasn't out of the box support for the Google Play store. The included app store has a poor selection of business and utility apps so if you're hoping to project Google Slides or PowerPoints without using the full size HDMI port, be prepared to do some creative problem solving for now. I contacted Anker support about this and they did state it's a work in progress and offered the $30 carrying case as a way to make up for it not meeting that specific need and they were very kind about it. They even answered outside of the operating hours their auto-reply mentioned and didn't make things difficult. If it wasn't for their great support I would have given the Capsule 3/5 but with the promise of continued updates and very helpful support, I'm hoping it'll soon deserve a 5.",4,
"Ben L. Dutton","Compact & Simple to Operate","I bought one of these for work as I give a lot of presentations and courses in a variety of locations, and I just bought 3 more for everyone else in my office.  I love that it's as small as a soda can and super lightweight.  The picture and audio are surprisingly good for a relatively inexpensive projector.  I love that it's wireless and rechargeable - I used to have to carry an extension cord and other connections for the laptop.I would give this thing 5 stars except for a couple of things.  First, short battery life - I get about 2 hours maximum per charge, which doesn't impact me much as most of my presentations are shorter than that.  Second, stability - due to it's size, it has a small footprint and can be easily knocked over and it doesn't do well on anything but totally horizontal surfaces.Bottom line is that this thing is a good value for the money.",4,2019-06-14 00:00:00.000
"Quadx","Very close to 5 stars","Anker did a very good job for this projector but there are few things missing, otherwise it would be 5 stars for me.Pro:1. Sound is loud enough comparing to the other one i have.2. Auto keystone works very well. (I am projecting it to the ceiling with a 45 degree)3. UI is very good that has amazon prime video, youtube, etc... (you can download other apps)4. UI is fast and responsive.5. Phone as remote is a very good touch.Cons:1. Not bright enough comparing to my other portable projector, i have to turn off all the light to get a good picture.2. Did not come with a tripod like other ones, ANKER tripod is overpriced.3. Remote should have used AAA battery instead.4. When projecting to the ceiling, due to the brightness, the bottom will be blurry.5. Resolution could be higher.Overall very happy with this portable projector.",4,
"brynja tomer","Don't buy Used - Like New - Item will come in original packaging. Packaging will be damaged.","The projector had a little dent, the input was broken and had to be changed before I charged it for the first time. It even had the name of a person registered as a user. It totally feels used and not like new.I didn't return it as it was shipped over to South America and it would have been too expensive for me.The projector works as expected but I was hoping to be able to use it in a non totally dark room.I thought the evaluation ""like new"" meant that it really was an item that looked like new but now I know that it is not the case at Amazon.",4,2021-01-05 00:00:00.000
"Dan","Great Device With a Slight Flaw in Software","I've had this handy device for a couple weeks and overall I've happy with it but I do have a few gripes.  The first problem is the lack of Google Play apps which is a substantial issue as a majority of the apps I want to use on it aren't available in their incredibly limited selection. I can plug a secondary device into the HDMI port to run what I want but that defeats the purpose of the mobility of the Capsule.  The other issue is with their remote app because it constantly disconnects mid use and I have to wait for the device to reconnect then hope it doesn't disconnect again before I do what I'm trying to do.Otherwise the Capsule definitely comes as advertised.  It's got a great picture for what it is and the speaker quality is much better than I expected it to be.  I currently have it set up in my basement with an 80"" screen and that has been working great.  I have also tested it outside at night for movie nights this summer and it works for that as well.TL;DR:  This is a great portable projector and I would highly recommend it to anyone with the understanding that it's not HD, it has an incredibly limited app selection & the companion app has connectivity issues",4,2018-05-02 00:00:00.000
"Peter","Looks good for what it is, but the resolution is pretty bad.","Bought this to add more color to my DJ streams, does the job well.Room has to be super dark and 480p at that picture size isn't super enjoyable.Other than that, works well enough. Haven't tried it on battery. Packaging is nice and the tripod mount is amazing.Wish the Nebula 2 was cheaper.",4,2020-07-25 00:00:00.000
"Amazon Customer","Value for money","I purchased during Black Friday with deal. It is solid portable device. Good to watch in low lighting as it’s only 100 ANSI. Android tv 7.1 has limited app. I use YouTub mostly so it’s fine. I’ve installed Samsung browser to see video on the webpage. Has limited input source only hdmi. It would be nice if they added micro sd slot. Still trying to figure out how to watch video from usb",4,2020-11-28 00:00:00.000
"J. Chou","Fantastic self contained portable projector","Revised review 4/4/19My recommendation:  If you are looking for an anywhere, everywhere projection device, Nebula is great. Good design and build quality. Netflix and Amazon Video are built-in. If that is all you do then Nebula is a neat package. Definitely download the controller app as the remote is cumbersome to use and to must have a clear line of sight with the receiver in the back.",4,2018-07-16 00:00:00.000
"YZ","Satisfied:)","I’m satisfied!! This can-size projector+speaker is exactly what I wanted. It works perfectly with my Apple products (for both mirror screening and HDMI) and I installed plenty apps on it for music and video streaming. (You can download APK apps first on your hard drive and plug it in to the projector to install them.) The picture quality, though not perfect, is good enough for movie nights with family and friends (picture quality is way better in darker rooms or at night.) The speaker is awesome and professional, and could even compare to my B&O speaker. The battery lasts about 3.5 hours on a full charge, the cord is too short so I cannot charge and watch at the same time. Overall, I’d give it 4 stars.",4,2019-07-24 00:00:00.000
"Amazon Customer","Great little projector!","Got this for my bedroom because I didn’t want to get a tv. Picture overall is good. The speaker is adequate but don’t expect a home theater sound.

"David D Van Wagoner","I miss the lens cap/switch on its big brother","Great little unit.  Super portable.  Surprisingly good sound.  Decent Battery life.  I had the larger version up until recently, and that was a really handy unit also.  I dropped one star because this little projector doesn't have the ""Lens Cap Switch"" the larger one has.  There is nothing to protect the lens from smudges.",4,2020-02-26 00:00:00.000
"Amazon Customer","User friendly except YouTube sign.","This project is amazing last night we watched a double feature off one charge including YouTube music before dark. How ever the YouTube app did not allow me to sign in even after reloading the app. Not being able to sign in was disappointing because I pay for no commercial. The commercial free YouTube would allow me to mingle with my family and friends before the movie starts.

"ARussell","Nebula Casule: A fun, solid portable projector","So far so good. The form factor is very good, construction is solid, and packaging is very well thought out, with most of the things you need to get started right away.I checked for software updates out of the box and it needed an updating, which happened smoothly and easily.Some concerns:The  app remote works better than the physical remote, although I haven’t tried to pair it over cell service yet.The onboard app versions of Netflix and Amazon video need the remote control app to be in controller mode to scroll, and mouse mode to select. That’s just inefficient.Mirroring of your iPhone will allow access to photos, music, etc — but the Bluetooth connection makes playing videos from your phone library frustrating. There’s quite a bit of lag which leads to jumpy streaming.I’ve read in other reviews that this Bluetooth lag issue throws video and audio out of sync when using a Bluetooth speaker for sound reinforcement. I haven’t tested that yet. The sound from the Capule itself is fine for a small- or medium-sized rooms, although the bass is lacking. Eventually I’ll want to improve the experience with a Bluetooth speaker, which may lead to the same problems other reviewers had. For now, it’s ok on its own.The image is not as bright as you might get from other units. In general, though, for its size, features, build quality and battery life, it seems like a good option for throwing into a bag for traveling.At this price, it may be steep for some users. I suggest doing a little checking on the Internet to see whether there are any promotional coupon codes that can be applied to bring down the cost of the unit. I’ve seen several this year that drop the cost by $50 to $70, which takes the sting out of the purchase a little.",4,2018-04-10 00:00:00.000
"Ileen","A good buy!","My favorite thing about this projector is how small and compact it is, so it’s really easy to lug around and bring to places. The projector does it’s job quite well. The projection is pretty HD and I have no complaints. Sound is pretty good as well. Setting it up was easy too. It has Netflix and other streaming apps built into it as well if you don’t have an HDMI cord to plug into another device. A few cons however is its short battery life and the fan is kind of loud but it’s not too bad to the point where it’s overpowering.",4,2021-06-29 00:00:00.000

I can watch my TV shows anywhere now. There are a couple instances the auto picture keystone feature is not perfect when used on none vertical surfaces and the remote control doesn't seem to work all the time and you need to position it to work.  Overall though no regrets in buying this projector.

"Tyler Macfarlane","High quality. Meh Value","All around a super nice product. Size of a can and projects well in a pony dark room and white wall. But the value is just not as good as I hoped.

"Blake Burton","Amazing purchase","I bought this for myself on Prime Day and honestly, overall, I love this thing. The pros absolutely outweigh the cons, all the way around. I use it to stream YouTube, Netflix, Hulu and Twitch about 99% of the time as a TV in my bedroom. I’ll either hang the screen I purchased from the hooks on the back of my closet doors opposite my bed, or I’ll lay in bed with it laying next to me and watch it on the ceiling - both of which are amazing.  My ONLY complaint at ALL about this item is the clarity during darker scenes of a show. The brightness is decent when it’s a dark environment, but even in a dark environment, if you’re watching a show with a low light scene, it’s sometimes a bit too dark for my tastes and hard to see parts of the scene. But again, overall, this is an amazing purchase and highly recommended.",4,2019-07-27 00:00:00.000
"Sig Sauer","Cool gadget, no brightness adjustment","Really awesome little product that is very innovative.

"Logan R","Update: (Almost) The Perfect Portable Projector.  Original Title: Received used item.","Update: So just to start I do have to say Anker's customer service really has been outstanding. They've kept in timely communication with me from the time of my original review to see how they could assist. They have more than apologized and informed me that they have taken steps that it doesn't occur again.In regards to the customer service I would give this a 5 but for the moment I will be giving the actual product 4 stars. To start I was nervous about the sub hd quality of the screen it was projecting but it honestly looks pretty good. I've primarily experimented projecting 50-60 inches and everything has looked good and subtitles are more than clear. The hardware overall is extremely nice and feels polished. Starts up fast and once up and running didn't experience slowdowns. I originally was worried the fan was loud because of a different review. With no sound and it sitting next to me I could absolutely hear it but it wasn't loud per say. With it set up on a tripod and it's speaker going during a movie though I could not hear the fan at all.Like others have mentioned software is lacking a bit still unfortunately. Netflix works how you'd expect and really didn't have any issues with it. Vudu is in the provided App Store and although I was able to sign in, I could not get it to scroll down to my library to view my movies. I had to already know what I was looking for and search for it to watch it from this app. Amazon Prime is available and worked pretty well, a bit hard to see sometimes where the ""cursor"" was but could log in and start up my movies with ease. Youtube works but is a bit barebones. Search works just fine and I didn't run into issues getting any particular video to play. It doesn't appear you can log into your profile so for those that have Youtube Red or utilize Youtube to access their google play library it doesn't appear possible at this present moment. Hulu for now looks to be absent. I did try to airplay it and interestingly enough it plays the ads but then once the movie/show starts the screen goes black and only the sound plays. They did warn in their description that copyrighted material can't be mirrored but I really wanted to get Hulu going. Speaking of mirroring it really doesn't work well. Though delayed it's by no means severely behind and though I wouldn't try to mirror an FPS game to it, something like Jackbox Party Pack would be feasible and fun.Original: I got mine today but at the moment I'm not thrilled. It came in a crushed box that looked like it already had been opened. When I powered it on it also already had predownloaded apps that had been logged into. I've generally had good experiences with Anker in the past but I'm surprised they would try to pass it off as new. I've already started the process to replace it with Amazon but I'm skeptical now.",4,2018-02-06 00:00:00.000

I bounce it off the ceiling with a photo tripod. Resolution is low but you don't notice too much.",4,2018-05-03 00:00:00.000

"Dls","Love, but a couple of issues","So I love this little projector , but on day two have two issues...1. After about 20 minutes on Netflix it pauses, black screen-like it goes to sleep. I have to press power and it comes back on in the place where it left off just paused and 2. I wish the volume were louder. I was playing a Spotify playlist and had it almost all the way up for medium vol. that was disappointing. Going to check w support.",4,2019-02-24 00:00:00.000
"Kristin","Nice projector","I love this projector.  We use it inside and out.  It needs to be actually dark out to use outside.  Closing the blinds is sufficient for inside use.

"MJ Poquiz","All in one package","I like this projector a lot, it’s clear and plenty bright at night filling an 80” pull down screen in the backyard sitting about 9 feet away.  App control is nice.  480p is good enough.  60 FPS would’ve been better, but it only appears to be only 30.What sets it apart is android TV.  I have NVIDIA Shields in every room using Kodi as my local media client, HDHomerun serving my cable tv signal all through a Synology NAS.  These apps all function the same in the projector.My gripes about this projector:It has dual band WiFi, but at 2.4GHz I get about 30Mbps down, while my iPhone right next to it gets about 130 down.  On 5GHz band, the projector is getting about 45Mbps down, while my phone next to it gets 300.The speaker isn’t that great, it’s pretty tinny sounding.  I just connect a JBL charge 3 to it through Bluetooth for better audio, but AV sync is a little lagged.Last complaint is more of my OCD, but I can’t get rid of the stupid TED app placeholder.  It’s the first one in line and it’ll never get used.Those are minor gripes I think, the WiFi issue hasn’t resulted in any video choppiness. I’ve used it at most about 3 hours straight so the battery life hasn’t been an issue.  I can attach a battery pack if needed.  I’m happy with my purchase.",4,
"DamienA","Easy to set up, but the Netflix experience could be improved","Comes with Netflix and a store app (not Google Play) that gives you easy access to other android TV apps. Netflix doesn't support the remote control, thus I will take a star off. To navigate in Netflix using the remote control you need to put it in mouse 🖱 mode, which is painful. Mouse mode from the phone using the Capsule Control app is better, but I think this mode should not be needed in the first place.",4,2018-08-26 00:00:00.000

The Eisman and the Anker branded Official Capsule case, which I got when I purchased the Capsule via a limited promotion Anker was running. Long story short, I prefer the Eisman case vs the official Capsule case.  The Anker case is softer and does not protect as well.  The outer shell is more of a sturdy cardboard, and does flex if stressed. The Eisman case barley gives, it's sturdy. I can place the capsule in my backpack and not worry when using the Eisman case. Not only is this case is more sturdy, but it's a smaller form factor. I'd travel with the Eisman case over the official. With the Eisman case, you sacrifice some storage space for form factor though, as it's just a bit smaller. With the Eisman case, the compartment that actually holds the projector is too small for the projector. The compartment stretches and bows when the projector is inserted, but does hold it very snugly. See pics. The official case has a larger  dedicated space for the remote and projector.  There isn't any space for cables in either case. I bought a telescoping tripod (see above links) to use with the capsule and it's okay, make sure to get a wider tripod base, as the one it ships with is small, and the Capsule topples over easily when dialing in the viewing angle of the image. But hey, I can say the capsule is sturdy.  As a whole, it does take a lickin' and keep on tickin'! An iPhone X would have shattered into a million pieces long ago.I love this projector. I use it everywhere, but especially in my room/bed, projecting onto the wall or ceiling. The combination of the Android OS and HDMI input make it very functional. I connect a Chromecast to the HDMI input and I'm able to stream everything...sling, HBO now, etc. I wish there was a more fully fledged YouTube app, as you can't log into your account, so no playlists, subscriptions, etc. Installing Kodi is straightforward and works well. While Hulu warns you that the app isn't compatible, it works well on the Capsule in my experience. The focus on the Capsule isn't great. I'm exaggerating a little, but if you blow on the focus knob it'll fall out of focus. It's very sensitive and very difficult to actually get a sharp focus. I like the auto sleep feature...if I fall asleep watching Netflix, the projector doesn't stay on burning the bulb all-night, it turns itself off. I'm not sure when, but it turns itself off at some point.  The projector image is not bright during the day, its not amazing at night either, but not bad at all. Brighter when plugged into power.  Battery life is good.  You'll get through a 2 hour movie, and then a little bit.  I haven't needed to tax the battery so much, I just use Anker power bricks to keep the party going lol.  The audio from the built in speaker is meh...good enough. It's great for my 'Netflix in bed' purposes so far. At halfway, its plenty loud (for properly mastered material...movies, etc).  As far as the audio fidelity, don't expect full bandwidth, wall of sound type of output.  It's a tinny miniscule speaker built into a projector, so it sounds as such, but its very easy to connect a bluetooth speaker, if you'd like.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase, and can't wait to use the projector in more places besides my home!",4,2018-09-17 00:00:00.000

"Josue","Great portable projector with main weaknesses being the remote controls","Great little portable projector. Bought it for use with my Nintendo Switch setup. Runs android 7.1 but lacks google play store but Anker says its coming. Projection quality is great for its size although not bright enough for using indoors during a sunny day without curtains or outside except after dark. My Switch looks great projecting at about 100"" on my wall. The sound from its speaker is the best out of the mini pico projector class although in bluetooth mode it doesn't get very loud.Comes with remote that is good but has the weakness of having the IR sensor in the back of the projector instead of the front. Would have been better if it was an RF based remote instead of IR. The smart phone control app is good when it works. It constantly disconnects from the projector about every 45 seconds and takes it about 20 seconds to reconnect. This repeats indefinitely.",4,2018-03-18 00:00:00.000

"Amazon Customer","Great Projector/Need Better UI and App Support","Out of the box it is amazing little projector.  For the price the image quality and sound were great.  Much better than I expected for the price.  I am looking forward to warm weather to get outside and start watching movies in the backyard or next to the pool.  I love the fact that it is all in one projector that does not require me to have a cell phone connected, a separate power or extension cord or a Bluetooth speaker.  It is all in one unit.  All I need is the projector, included remote and a white wall.I would have given in 5 stars if the user interface and app selection were better.  I find the User Interface to be clunky and not intuitive.  This is manageable once you get used to it.  There is not a lot of customization options such as how the apps are ordered and displayed on the Home Screen.The biggest fault is that it is running a stripped down version of Android Nougat.  The Android software is not running ""Google Play Services"".  The lack of Google Play Services does not allow you to run certain apps like NBC, NBC Sports and FoxNow.  Ultimately, with access to Amazon Video and Netflix I can cover 95% of my TV/Movie watching needs but it would be nice to have access to the other services.  I am not sure what ""Google Play Services"" does so I do have some concerns about future inoperability  if Netflix or Amazon Video require the use of""Google Play Services"" to run those apps.Also there was a lack of available Music Apps such as Amazon Music and Pandora.  You can use the projector as a Bluetooth speaker and stream these services from your phone but not a lot of option if you want to play music directly through the projector.  I did find that Spotify was an available app.I am going to try using an old Roku Stick connected to the HDMI port to get better access to the TV/Movie/Music Services.  As I said above if this projector has a better User Interface and App selection (like Roku) it would be absolutely amazing.",4,2018-04-18 00:00:00.000

"THATCHMAN1","This device is amazing","We live in the future. The end... Actually no. I have updated the review at the bottom.This device is amazing, and is exactly what I was looking for! I've been on a hunt for this for years and it didn't yet exist. I had a Sony pico projector in the past but the software was so limiting, connections were limited, this one supports just about any kind of connection you'd like to make.Both on the same wifi network? Got it.Stand Alone connection to wifi, with no PC or secondary device to provide the content? Yes!Screen mirroring for iOS? Yes! And Mac!Screen mirroring for Android and Miracast? Yes!I as able to set the device up and start using it within just a couple minutes of unboxing. Everything is intuitive. My intent for this device is as an ultra portable projector for work, and it will do that perfectly. I was shocked at how far away I could be from the wall and how large the screen could be and everything was still okay. In the dark you can project to almost an entire wall at a quality that most family movie night goers would be pleased with.The stand alone app for your smart phone helps immensely for setting up applications and entering logins & passwords.The built in speaker is surprisingly clear and loud. This thing is literally the size of a can of soda pop. Unreal.The fan is very quiet and doesn't seem to surge up/down as some projectors can, at least so far during my use.I can only imagine that things can get  better from here-- more apps in the app store (It has a built in app store specifically for it's use! Netflix, Amazon video worked well for me. I couldn't get Hulu to work... yet)The menus are very easy to navigate, it has a file explorer which means theoretically if you have regular videos or content that you wanted to play without an internet connection you could do so. I could imagine great uses for mobile road warriors, sales teams, etc.I have spent so many months trying to find a device like this and it just didn't exist.  There were a couple attempts from other companies but the reviews just didn't cut it. The Sony I had was expensive and far more limited than this.We live in the future, and I'm very happy that we do. I love this device! I'll continue to try it with additional computer mirroring and use the physical HDMI connection and update the review if there are any surprises.[UPDATE]While I can't take back the excitement and love above, I realized that the consumer strength being what it is on the entertainment side, I had a couple gaps on the business side that made the value proposition difficult for me over time. I ended up returning the unit.I couldn't' figure out a way to cast from Chromebook, which is an important thing for the future where I work. Second, I had some resolution challenges for Windows 10 screen mirroring even from older laptops. It would make everything so ""big"" that I couldn't display enough on the projection to be as productive as I hoped to be.My original desire with this device was to do wireless projections from computers for town halls, impromptu sit down meetings, all work related. While it does a lot of great stuff, I needed those two things to be top of the list and the long term performance on those didn't quite make it for me.I'll be keeping my eyes open for the next iteration of this device, as it's well made and does a ton of great stuff. Just not quite well enough on the business use cases.",4,2018-01-23 00:00:00.000

"Oliver","Very good  (not perfect)","This thing is awesome. Great picture.I have a few complaints:I'd prefer it if the picture were just a little brighterUpdate: they have a beta version with Google Play support now. It works well. The only downside is that you can't add shortcuts for Google and Google play store apps to the home screens. So a ceasing those is a bit of a pain.The delighters:the form factor is greatthe battery last really long for a device this size. two movies, easythe picture is sharpthe control app for your smart phone is greatthe customer service is super responsive (they changed the controller app, and made it worse. I sent them an email, and they undid the bad change within a week. I lost my charger, they are sending a replacement, they added me to the Google play beta without fuss)I installed the projector on my ceiling and am projecting on a screen on the wall. It's a nice setup. The sound is remarkably adequate with this setup. And the best thing is the size of the projector. We don't own a TV, and this thing is great for the occasional movie.I came to this projector after a somewhat long journey that led me from multiple cheaply made projectors to this quality projector by Anker (an actual reputable brand).There are a bunch of cheap projectors on amazon that all follow a similar pattern: The same device is being sold with different brand names. There are no websites for the brands, or if there are, then the websites seem to have been translated into English with Google Translate. The reviews on amazon seem to be planted by the company, and again, Google Translate seems to have been used. Stay away from those products. You'll be playing the return game. I must have sent 7 projectors back to Amazon, wanting to believe that one of them was good. Ultimately a reputable brand, like Anker, was the win. It is much more expensive ($350 vs. sub $100 to $268), but it is worth it. Because the product is great, support is great, and updates are released regularly. Just research your product through google before you buy it. You'll see.",4,2018-02-18 00:00:00.000

"team W","Pleasantly Surprised - Typical Anker Quality","I am one of those people that is fussy about video quality.  So I picked this up on a lightening deal, not sure if I would ultimately even want to keep it.  I took a gamble, in large part because I've had good luck with Anker products in the past.This gadget does not disappoint.  The picture quality of this little thing is considerably better than I expected it to be.  In a fully dark room, the contrast is better than I expected it to be, and so is the color saturation.  It is also considerably sharper than I thought it would be given the resolution isn't even 720p.  But apparently the resolution calculus with a projector is a bit different, given that you are likely going to be sitting much farther away from the screen.Here is my experience: I set it up in a dark room, and just pointed it at a blank wall 6 feet away, no special projector screen.  That yielded a picture about 80"" measured diagonally.  If you sit behind the projector at about 10 feet away from the wall, that 80"" picture looks far better than it has any right to be.  It is an image you can comfortably watch all evening, without once thinking ""geez, I really should have bought a 'real' projector.""  That is frankly an amazing accomplishment for something as small as this.So what about if you want that big picture but want to sit closer?  The short answer is you probably need to spend a whole lot more money and get something that isn't portable.At about 6 feet from the wall, you start to see that DLP screen door effect with an 80"" image.  It is not horrible, but to my eyes, you don't want to be closer than about 8 feet away from the 80"" image.  I think it is no accident that the remote control receiver is on the back of the unit, as you will probably want to sit behind this projector if you are using it for movie nights or that kind of thing with a very large image.  I would definitely move the unit closer and make the image smaller than 80"" if I had to sit closer than about 8 feet away.  So how happy you are with the image is going to depend a lot on your specific viewing situation.  Big room + Big image = Cool.  Small room + Big Image = Meh.I also tried the ""Netflix on the ceiling"" thing in bed.  In a dark room the brightness is good, and the resulting image is perfectly watchable and nicely sized.  You will get a slight screen door effect because you are a lot closer to the image.  I didn't find it terribly bad or distracting.  What I did notice is that you really have to use your phone to control the device in this mode, because the remote sensor is going to be covered up.  If you don't have the phone handy, you will have to set up whatever you are watching by holding the device up closer to the ceiling so you can get at the remote sensor, then lay it back on the pillow once the program is running.  Not a huge deal, but you are definitely not channel surfing in this mode without your phone.As for commercial use: if the room isn't completely dark, you can still get a watchable image, but you will probably need to shrink it down by moving the projector closer.  This is not a projector you want to use in a big, well-lit conference room where you also need a large image.  But in a smaller, more dimly lit room, it has enough zip to likely get by.  I will say I think it looks better watching movies than displaying static text.  You kind of notice the resolution limitations a little more when reading things off the screen vs. watching video.  Unless you really need portability over everything else, there are probably better, brighter choices out there for commercial use or in places where you can't get the room dark.Sound quality is a good notch better than I expected it to be given the size.  It can get pretty loud, loud enough to fill the room.  Yes, there isn't much bass, but that is to be expected.  Again, if you are just casually watching a movie or some YouTube video, it is fine.  And you can output to an external bluetooth speaker or headphones if you want better sound quality or need to watch silently.The device seems nicely built, with typical Anker-level attention to quality.  There is nothing cheap or chintzy about how this operates or is put together.  It feels and operates like a premium product.  The interface and software seem to work well. The iPhone app that turns your iPhone into a remote control for it seems to work well, and the included remote has a ""mouse"" mode that allows you to work with apps that require it if you don't have your phone connected to it.I did the screen mirroring thing with my iPhone and that worked generally pretty well too.  You CAN watch non-copy protected video stored on your iPhone by wirelessly mirroring your screen to the Capsule.  The connection seems pretty stable and it generally worked fine.  It does send audio out to the speaker on the Capsule as well, and the sound is properly in sync with the video.  However, there is noticeable screen lag when mirroring wirelessly from the phone, so don't expect to do anything like gaming or whatever using the mirrored phone image.I also plugged a USB thumb drive into it using the included adapter.  That also generally worked fine, assuming you have video encoded in a modern, recent format.  It choked on some older DIVX and AVI files, but smoothly played even higher resolution, modern files using VLC.  So if you are planning to play a lot of files off a thumb drive, you will want to confirm the format you are using is one it can handle.Of particular interest for a device like this, the device has a few gigs of included storage, allowing you to download from Amazon Prime or Netflix (Netflix has download available only on some titles), and then store the files on the device for later viewing off line.  So you can put a few things on the device itself without having to rely on the external USB connection.  You aren't going to put a whole library of stuff on the device, but there is room for a few movies.  That is going to be a very handy feature for traveling, given the sketchy WiFi in most hotelsYes there is a fan, and yes you can hear it if you sit close to the projector.  I didn't find it overly loud and intrusive, and it didn't bother me.  I also like the fact that you can attach a tripod to the bottom, that will likely come in handy.What don't I like?The lack of a physical headphone jack.  Bluetooth audio streaming is all you get here.  That is annoying on a phone, but really kind of inexcusable on a device that is so much larger.  When your bluetooth headphones die, if you aren't somewhere where you can play the audio through the speakers, movie time is over.  You WILL be annoyed by this at some point, it is practically guaranteed.No hard case included.  This product is expensive, and it comes in a very fancy cardboard box with a magnetic closure and LOTS of foam to protect the device in transit.  Take the money spent on the fancy box everyone is just going to throw away, and give me a hard-sided, padded case to help protect this while traveling.  There is no protective cover for the lens, and the little fabric case it comes with is inadequate.  This is not a $50 battery bank, it really should come with a proper travel case.You cannot charge the device or keep it plugged in while streaming off of a USB drive, there is only one USB port.Overall:  This is a pretty good casual entertainment/traveling device.  It is not going to replace a $2,000 projector that is about as portable as a cinder block, but it isn't trying to.  Instead, it is a small, convenient projector you can take almost anywhere, and will give you surprisingly good performance for its size.  It could even get by in less demanding commercial applications.  Unlike a lot of these projectors on Amazon that are sold by some random company you've never heard of, Anker has a built a reputation for putting out quality stuff, and this projector is no exception.",4,2018-07-20 00:00:00.000
"Amazon Customer","Portable Projector/Speaker the size of a soda can with Built in Apps.","I've been using the Nebula Capsule for about a week and so far, I'm pretty happy with it.  I'll get the things I don't like about it out of the way:1. Could be brighter (but hey, it's the size of a soda can and you get 4 hours of playtime).2. It's only 480p. (wish it was 720p or higher but again it's the size of a can and the battery life is pretty good). 480p is ""DVD quality""3. Apps - App store is decent (Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Video, etc.)  but would be even better if it had access to the Google Play store (more on that later).4. Unable to log into my YouTube account (more on that later)5. Focus is a mixed bag. If you adjust the focus to have a sharp picture for things that are in the center of the screen, stuff that's near the edges will be a bit blurry. You'll need to spend some time tweaking the focus and settle for a happy medium.Now for what I like/love1. The size and build quality. Nice metal construction and again it's the size of a soda can.2. Speaker. While it's not super loud, it gets the job done. It has 360 sound and does fill a room. It's nice that if you want, you can pair it with a bluetooth speaker or even bluetooth headphones.3. It can be used as a stand alone bluetooth speaker.4. HDMI port - This device will take just about anything that uses HDMI. I tried it with my cable box, Nintendo Switch and even a Firestick. Everything worked great.5. Anker Support!!! I reached out to Anker because I wanted to know if there's a way to be able to sign into my YouTube account (which would allow me to watch my purchased movies).  Not only did they help with this but they walked me through downloading an updated version of Android which not only allowed me to sign into YouTube but also allowed me to have access to the Google Play store, Google Movies, Chrome, etc.  This made the device even better. I now have access to all my owned digital movies and tons of apps.6. Internal Storage - You have about 8 gigs of internal storage so you can save a few movies directly to the device and watch them if you don't have wi-fi access.Do I wish it was brighter and had a sharper picture? Sure but if you accept it for what it is and appreciate what it can do based on it's size and portability, it's pretty awesome.I've tested it inside and outside. I've gotten it to display up to 100+ inches. Watched videos on the ceiling, on the garage, out on the deck, etc.  This may not be for everyone but it's nice to have such a small device that allows you to have portable entertainment whenever and wherever you want.I've included 3 photo's - One to show the size, one indoor (watching The Dark Knight via Amazon Instant Video) and one playing Fortnite outside on the deck (100 inches) on a white sheet.",4,2018-08-26 00:00:00.000
"Voodoo Daddy-O","Surprisingly great little projector!","Surprisingly good for such a small projector. I like having apps like Amazon Prime Video built into the device, and I like the 4-hour battery and built-in speaker. It’s so convenient. It’s a lot better than having to connect a laptop or Blu-ray player and a speaker to a projector. Only complaints: The image is a little dim (which is to be expected from a projector that really is about the size of a soda can), and the built-in App Store is a bit limited. It isn’t powerful enough for a home theater setup, but it’s perfect for movies in the backyard or watching a big game.",4,2019-08-20 00:00:00.000
"Pavel Bulanov","Portable high-quality bright and loud projector with good battery, fast Android (no GMS yet). Picture quality is mediocre though","The projector is indeed compact (although not tiny), well-made, with fast interface, relatively bright, good sounding (for its size and price), having good battery life, and overall appealing. Its main weakness for me, even thought more or less expected, is actual picture quality - which is rather mediocre. I was expecting this from a small projector, but it's too far from desired to be a serious thing. I consider this as a ""toy"" therefore (compact and fancy), but it can't be ever traded for ""real"" powerful projector in viewing experience.In a nutshell, the projector met my expectations after reading several reviews and forums beforehand. I still wish it had better resolution and more contrast. But if you read available information, you will have pretty much accurate impression with no surprises.Advantages:- Device quality is very good to my mind, it's well built, nice-looking, made of pleasant materials, even packaging is high-quality. It's compact, not feather-light but still easy to handle. Using standard micro USB charger is a convenience. I wish it was USB Type C though, it's already 2018.- Outlook is quite pretty. Somewhat asymmetric placement of lens hollow is weird, though.- Image brightness is rather above expectation. It's quite visible even in partly lit room on a cloudy day (not in bright conditions, obviously), and normally visible in gloomy conditions, not only in complete darkness. I could get bright-enough picture of about 100"" in dark room. No complaints for its size.- Battery life is sufficient for my ""normal"" needs, e.g. I could easily watch 2 hours movie with sound and battery not dying still. I could also plug it into power bank while keep it playing, which is extremely convenient. One note - you can't easily find battery level rather then going to home screen. I wish device had some level of indication on itself, e.g. several LED marks (grade) in contrast to just semi-useless ""nebula"" word lightning on top.- Having remote control is a plus. It's very light and small. I wish it had at least play / pause dedicated button and surprised it's not there. It's also working very directly, I have to aim it at the back side of Capsule, otherwise it won't work.- Capsule Control mobile application helps a lot with text input, but I wouldn't call it convenient in navigation. You have to look at projected image while dragging finger over the phone. I wish it rather used phone gyroscope and LG Magic Remotes like pointer navigation with movement, rather than blind interaction.- Sound quality is more then needed from this portable small device. It's very loud by itself (e.g. when playing YouTube by built-in app). Same time, projecting via Miracast (both from phone or laptop) reduces sound volume very significantly (like 5 times lower, I first thought it's not working).- Android is very fast, zero lags. Custom interface is straightforward and clean. Don't know exactly what benefits Android 7.1.2 brings here, as interface is completely custom and there is no Google Play; still nice it's not outdated 4.4 Kitkat.- Screen mirroring - works as expected, didn't notice any problems for casting videos (didn't check for lags specifically). Tried from Android phone and Windows 10 laptop, all worked fine. Minor usability aspect - Screen Mirroring menu item, which is required to initiate casting, is for some reason ""hidden"" under Settings -> General and not on the main screen. Also, dedicated remote button for like Source selection would be beneficial.- Having standard full-size HDMI port is a plus. Luckily, you don't have to select HDMI input menu item for it to work (although it's present), it starts automatically. Sound volume is also much lower in this case, comparing to using built-in applications.Major points / wishes:- Picture quality - I wish resolution was higher, as 854x480 is too small, even for watching videos. Picture is not crisp, and not contrast enough for pleasant experience. It reminds me of old days with CRT TVs (in terms of quality and not size, obviously). Contrast is especially insufficient for dark-themed movies, e.g. Peaky Blinders style. Again, this is absolutely known and not a surprise at all, but beware.- Fan sound is higher then anticipated, considering the unit is not too powerful. Fan is very well audible, subjectively similar to fans of a powerful laptop under heavy load. Not an expert here, I was expecting it to be calmer considering claimed power consumption under 10W for everything: speaker, CPU and projector itself, and 15W LED E27 bulbs not require any active cooling (this is a very amateur view, obviously).- I would expect it to have some sort of lens cover, especially because it's portable. Device is overall metal, but unprotected lens glass requires very careful handling.- Still expecting Google Services to be available, as having limited app store and inability to login is a significant inconvenience. It doesn't even store YouTube history so I always need to start searching from scratch (am I doing something wrong?)- I wish focus setup would be automatic, as tuning it manually with tiny sensitive knob is not convenient (and remember, this thing is portable and therefore not sits in one place). Or being a laser projector, they say no focus tuning is needed then.- (minor point) it always loses Wi-Fi network after leaving stand-by mode, so I lose my video viewing position.",4,2018-03-11 00:00:00.000
"Sir Bob Davis","Terrible product with many fake reviews (updated)","My first question: Are you kidding me?  We received the package at 6:30 pm.  Opened it up right away.  Unable to connect to our phones.  Huawei and Pixel 3 (latest model).  For the record, we aren't technology dumb dumbs.  We spent 1+ hours messing with this thing and absolutely no way to connect Bluetooth and airplay (cast).  In less than 2 hours, the projector is going back in the box for return.  What a waste of time!Update (Dec 19th, 2018):  Our review was a bit harsh because we were extremely frustrated.  However, Anker contacted us and we worked things out.  So, I changed the 1 star to 4.

It seemed unlikely that something so small could give such a big impact in the projector world with the sound quality it gives. I had some issues with the physical remote and the app. So I reached out to Anker and they help me resolve the issues I was having. First by replacing my remote without question and then by helping figure out how best to configure the app, so it works properly with the device. I felt that Angela in particular came through, followed up and stayed on top of the situation until it was resolved. Thank you Angela!!!

"Donald P.","Almost perfect","I purchased this product July of last year for $350 and I love it!  I have used this product as a backyard projector along with a screen which I purchased from Elite (which is amazing btw). The Nebula is terrific for what it is.  Size, portability, and quality are great.  I have one issue that made me not give it 5 stars.  The remote does not work unless you are sitting directly behind the projector.  An inconvenient design flaw when you position the Nebula behind you or beside you.  You have to get up, stand behind it and point for it to work. This is annoying if you need to adjust the volume or pause or simply surf for content.  Although you can circumvent this with the app on your phone, you then have the light from the phone to deal with.  This could have been improved. Overall it is a fun projector and does what it promises.  I really like the unit.  Take advantage of the $249 Cyber Monday price.  You won't be disappointed.",4,2018-11-26 00:00:00.000
"Mark H.","I had to write this review after the incredible support I recieved.","I purchased the Nebula Capsule to use mainly when I go camping. It works surprisingly well and was easy to set up. I had been using it about 6 weeks when I had an issue with it. The network antennae was not allowing it to connect to the wifi signal. I was worried until I called Nebula and spoke with Adam K. a Customer Support Engineer. This had to be the best experience dealing with an issue that I have ever had. They emailed me a return label next day postage paid and I had a new unit in hand within 5 days. This is how a company takes care of their valued customers. The Capsule is a really cool unit. The size and portability sets it apart from it's competition. Battery life is as stated.

"Nathaniel Hendrie","Cool device, software is limiting, but their support really cares","I bought the capsule for travel & outdoor movies, and thus far it has been great.  It is portable, has really good battery life and the picture and sound are great for what I need.  The reason I took a star off is because the software on the device is limiting, in terms of apps that can be added to the device, content that can be AirPlayed to the device and the Netflix library in the app on the device.  Capsule support was great in helping out with some of these, they really went above and beyond and followed up with me on their own (unheard of!), but I worry that it shouldn't take an exchange with support to get the device really cooking.If they took the 2 part setup process now and got it to be the out of the box experience, this would be a 5 star product.  I really hope they do.",4,2018-08-22 00:00:00.000

Still, overall this is a great little projector to have on the good when you want a big screen to watch in decent quality with pretty good sound for a projector this small. One other thing I really like is whenever you move the projector to a different angle or surface, it automatically adjusts the screen to fill the space so that's pretty convenient without having to move the projector back and forth to get the right size on the surface.",4,2021-01-12 00:00:00.000

"Kindle Customer","Great hardware, but software doesn't work.  Do not buy unless you want to project from HDMI source only.","I very rarely write reviews on Amazon, but I feel compelled to write a review for this product because there is relatively little public information online about it.  From an engineering perspective, the device is amazing - it's small and powerful, with good brightness for its size.  And if all you want to do is plug in an HDMI cable and project, you'll be happy.  However, to me, the real promise of this device was that it runs Android and should be able to operate entirely wirelessly via apps or casting, and these functions simply do not work.  Here's the deal:The Nebula Capsule does indeed run Android, but it doesn't have Google Play and most apps that you'd want to use are either not available or do not work.  For example, I was trying to watch the Olympics and the NBC Olympics app wouldn't install because Play Services aren't available.  NBC Sports installs ok but doesn't work because it needs the user to log in via a web browser and the Nebula doesn't have a browser.  The story was pretty much the same for all other apps I tried - they are either unavailable in the limited app store provided by the Nebula, they are available but won't install, or they install but don't work.Now, in theory you shouldn't have to install any apps on the Nebula because you should be able to cast from your smartphone to the Nebula.  However, casting is simply not functional from an Android phone - the Nebula doesn't show up in the casting options.  Nebula support says this is because the App isn't yet verified by Google Play, but I'm skeptical because the Nebula does show up in casting options from an iPhone but the casting is super-flaky.  Over the course of about three weeks with the device, I've tried to cast roughly 50 times.  Roughly 50% of the time it simply doesn't cast, and the app on my iPhone just goes blank while the Nebule is also blank.  The other 50% of the time it casts for a random interval of 1-10 minutes and then fails for no obvious reason.Overall, the hardware on this device is amazing, but the software is simply not ready for prime time.  I'll try buying one again in a few months, maybe.",2,2018-03-03 00:00:00.000
"Poppy Seaberry","I’m keeping it, but...","The stripped-down version of Android is a real bummer, I must say. Kills the potential of this projector. It’s still better than all the other mini models, but it also costs a lot more, too, so I was hoping for more.The good:* Picture is bright enough in a dim room and great in a dark room. My walls are beige, not white, and it performs fine without a screen. I’m getting a screen soon, so I’ll update when I do. It’s still a mini projector, and portability is going to come with compromise.* I like the form factor. It fits nicely in a case made for the Amazon Tap speaker; it’s shorter than the speaker but about the same width, so I got that case and put in a bit of springy foam as support. There’s room for the power cord, also, though not the remote. (This $7 hack was better than the $40 case made for the Nebula.)* Sound is impressive for a small speaker that’s more than a speaker. It’s as loud as my Anker SoundCore, which is loud enough for my needs. Won’t fill a large room, but is perfectly serviceable for a few people watching a movie.* The interface is fine. It’s what you would expect from any non-standard Android iteration.* The two apps I tested which support downloads on other mobile devices also support downloads here (Netflix and Amazon). So I can conceivably download a season of whatever old show I’m bingeing at the moment and not require any additional devices.* The iOS app which accompanies the device is great. A much smoother experience than remote only, although the remote is perfectly useable as well. I like that there are two modes - mouse and “control”, which each serve a specific purpose to navigate most effectively. And there’s a full touch keyboard which helpfully allows you to skip the whole painful hunt and peck process which the remote requires.* Battery life claims seem about right, based on one usage period.And now the bad:* No Google Play store, meaning no access to the apps I want. I bought this mainly for one specific app, which I cannot install. Streaming from another device works, but the whole reason I opted for an Android-enabled device was to have access to apps. Granted, my app isn’t top ten most popular Play Store fare, but it shouldn’t matter. This is an Android device. That’s deeply disappointing. I nearly returned it because of that (except that the other options which do allow me to install my app perform at a much lower level in general).* Light is within acceptable limits for a mini projector, but based on price and design, I don’t see why they couldn’t have packed a bit more brightness in this thing.* The Netflix app requires the iOS app to function. It doesn’t support the remote control. What??? Why?* Controls on the device itself are minimal, and do not allow it to function without the remote. If you lose the remote, you may lose the ability to operate your device. The app probably mitigates that issue, except that already twice I’ve encountered some interface struggles that I could only resolve using the back button on the remote (not in the app).  So maybe it doesn’t. Don’t lose your remote.* No USB ports. There’s a microUSB to USB dongle which allows for a USB connection of a thumb drive or whatever, but it’s a dongle. I hate dongles. One more thing to forget/lose.  Would it have been so hard to add a single USB port??...Overall it’s a good device. Certainly better than other mini projectors I’ve tried. If you’re satisfied with the apps their stripped-down OS seems worthy of download, you’ll be happy with the device. I’m keeping it even with my complaints simply because the speaker is great, it isn’t super buggy like other devices in the same genre, and I’m not going to find a better option than this. But there’s just no good reason I can see to omit Play Store.",3,2018-04-26 00:00:00.000

"amazonian","2 weeks, 7 etc support calls and  $76 worth of hdmi cables and connectors but still doesn’t work.","Mine had a ton of problems. I called customer support about 5 times and ultimately couldn’t get it to work. When I clicked on Netflix on the home screen it would neither download Netflix nor play Netflix. So I called and they gave me a work around, a google play password to download the google store. I did that only to find that there was no enter button. Not on the remote or on the iPhone nebula connect app. So I called again and they told me to hold down the mouse button on the remote until I got a pointing hand cursor which I could use my remote arrows to navigate around. Finally I could scroll down enough to get to the enter button. Success!  Google play store finally downloaded. A series of steps was completed and I restarted after the install. Now I went to try to download Netflix. I typed netflix in the search window but Netflix didn’t appear. So I couldn’t download the app. Giving up on that, I tried to download amazon prime from the google play app because that’s the other way I watch movies. Well I found amazon prime app and I downloaded it, but when I tried to log in I kept getting stuck at the Captcha. Again and again and again and again I’d enter my very long password with that cumbersome remote. And then when I’d enter the captcha it would say there was an error. This was supposed to be plug n play. Open the capsule. Click Netflix from the home screen. Log in and watch my Netflix!!! By now it’s 2 weeks and about 7 phone calls to customer service in and I still can’t play a movie from my projector. What can I do?  I can project my photos using screen mirroring. But that’s kinda boring. And o can’t screen mirror movies From Amazon prime or Netflix because it is copyrighted and it won’t screen mirror.So next customer service tells Me that I should try hardwiring my phone to the projector. That way if I am playing Netflix or Amazon prime on my phone it will go through the HDMI cable and directly into the Nebula and will project! This is not the point and shoot I was hoping for but I was excited to try it. After spending $56 on an Apple proprietary lightning cable to HDMI set up, and another $18 on an HDMI to HDMI cable, I was ready to watch a movie!  But no.  I connected my phone the other cables to the Nebula and no matter what I did the Nebula just did not see the HDMI input. Even though I bought the fancy made for iPhone proprietary cable connectors. So now I’ve spent $300 on the Nebula and I’ve spent $76 on cables and the thing just doesn’t work. They have advanced my customer service to a higher level of tech-support and no one can help me so I am returning it. I am going to have them send me another a capsule. Maybe this one was defective? Nothing should be so hard.  If I can’t get this one working with ease I’ll just give up.",1,2019-10-07 00:00:00.000
"Jay Pinks","A Good Attempt but Needs Improvement","I purchased the Nebula Capsule Smart Mini Projector as a gift so I can not review it for long term use.I inspected the projector to ensure it works because it is going to family overseas and can not easily be exchanged if needed.  I am happy I did this because there was a small problem with the remote.  The battery door was broken and would not stay in place.  Anker contacted me directly via email to ask about the purchase and when I informed them of the problem they had a new remote to me in 3 days.  I am always impressed with Anker's customer service.I attached the Nebula Capsule to a camera tripod and found it fit perfectly.It powered on with an almost full charge out of the box.  The one I purchased is black and it has a slick look.  As described it is similar in size and weight to a can of soda.The material quality is top-notch.  The casing feels like it is built to last, mostly of metal.The size makes it very portable.  I paired it with a hard-shell travel case for safer transportation.It comes with a wall charger and cable.  If you wish to use it while  charging I would recommend purchasing a longer cable as the included one is short.I was not impressed with the app interface.  Using the included remote is clunky and for using my phone as a remote I am forced to have both the bluetooth and location turned on even when connected to the same wifi router.The Nebula Capsule has an app store of sorts but many of the more popular services did not work. No Hulu. No Prime. Netflix worked but the interface is poor;  namely it would freeze while searching and then scrolls up or down for no reason.  YouTube is available but it did not have an option for me to sign into my account.The sound quality is not great.  It does get loud but loud does not equal clear audio.  It is not in stero and I did not see a way to connect to external speakers.  There may be a way but I was only testing the basics.The picture quality is not full HD but good for a portable projector in this price range. The room needs to be almost completely dark.I think it would work well for a basement room or any room with no windows. Otherwise I can not see it working well without blackout curtains or waiting for night fall.The portability is nice and I can see the four hour play time working well for (night time) outdoor use while camping or just enjoy a nice night outside.For the price I would recommend it but barely.

"Samuel Lee","Lovely outside, but the guts on this unit leaves something to be desired.","Out of the box the unit itself is a solid piece of hardware, well constructed, metal grill over the speakers and a thick chasis that looks like it can take a fall or two without hurting the unit itself, the lens is recessed far enough that it won't get scratched easily but for that extra layer of protection a small bag is included with the packaging.So that's the good... what about the bad?The operating system being Android 7.1 is fine but even with the basic apps (youtube, netflix, opera browser) I've already taken up over half of the built in memory. That doesn't leave much room for videos etc. While the usb port may be used for expanded memory (although one raises the issue on how you would charge the unit) the fact that you don't have a micro sd slot seems like a poor design decision.As far as apps are concerned Youtube is problematic because I can't seem to login to my youtube account despite me pressing the ""login"" button many times it just doesn't respond. Netflix responded ok so that's a big plus.The remote control app that I downloaded on my phone is fine although it can get a bit sluggish and swapping back and forth from keyboard and mouse can get frustrating.Framerate wise this projector can get choppy so please keep that in mind especially if you are a gamer...To summarize..The GoodBuild qualityPortabilityKeystoning is a breeze and the focus is greatBrightness if you don't need 100 inches or more and you are in a dark room, for me this unit is fine for the netflix ceiling projector binge watching.The BadDespite this being an Android system your app store is limited as it's not linked to Google PlayOnboard ram/rom is not sufficient for a smooth experienceYoutube app is buggyRemote control app seems buggyAirplay for me had quite a bit of lag and framerate lossTo sum things up, I got this on sale so I'm not angry about the purchase. Will this replace my TV? No. Not at all. Is this a handy little thing to have to bring out at parties, camping trips, or on the road? Definitely in fact that's where this unit shines the best. If you want a portable all in one that you can take anywhere to watch something in the dark this is fine, if you want more than that? I recommend searching elsewhere.",3,2018-05-22 00:00:00.000
"Yeah No","No Longevity. Sporadic functionality","It's been about a month since purchase. My intent with this device was for long usages. Not just a one movie and done. I've kept it plugged in the entire time, we aren't talking about battery issues.The first few weeks it was amazing and stayed on as long as I needed it as long as it was plugged in.Now. Going on week 6, I try to play one movie and it just shuts off randomly. I don't know why. Overheating? The only way to fix the issue is to reboot the system.Getting fed up with an item that was multiple hundreds of dollars to fail so spectacularly.Pertinent details: I use the hdmi port to a chromecast and keep the projector plugged in the entire time.

"Amazon Customer","Almost love it. Not worth the price.","This was so expensive, $300. So I was hoping it would be everything I was hoping for. i mean, its decent, but for the price? It has some shortcomings.The sound is not good, and they brag so about it. You’ll want to hook a Bluetooth speaker up.The fan inside is super loud. So the poor sound quality struggles to overpower it. Hook that Bluetooth speaker up.The remote control sucks. You have to be pointing directly at the back of the nebula in order for it to register, which is extremely inconvenient.The app that lets you control the nebula from your phone, yeah, that sucks too. Connective issues, frustrating controls that don’t always work.Apps are limited and outdated through their own Apptoid Store. Annoying.Some apps have issues, and can’t be used with the remote control, like Netflix. You HAVE to use the crappy phone app.The battery life only lasts one movie. But you can use it while it’s plug in. Get a portable charger.(Might at well get a bigger projector with better sound and battery life.)You’re not able to adjust screen size or angle on your own. Sometimes it corrects angle on its own, sometimes it doesn’t. Annoying. Screen size can only be adjusted by physically moving the nebula closer or farther away from the screen. So sometimes you are just not able to get the size you need or want. It can be difficult or impossible in some of the spaces you will be in. And you will have to watch your movie on a screen that is either entirely too small or too big.It’s a decent projector, but is not worth what they are charging when it has so many short comings. I’m sure there are more, and I will add them as I notice and remember.",3,2020-05-16 00:00:00.000
"robert clee","Terrible Software and Barely Usable!!","I was really excited for this to show up with the NFL Championship games coming up this weekend. I have AT&T TV for live television which is available on my Roku, Amazon Fire and pretty much every other device. The Nebula loaded software is just flat out terrible!! AT&T TV is not available and cannot be projected via Airplay. I know I can use an HDMI from my iPhone but for me that completely defeats the purpose of buying an expensive PORTABLE projector.Netflix and Disney+ using the AppToid software requires the Nebula app vs the provided remote. I prefer a remote, Roku and Fire TV UI work well with their remotes and that is the experience I am looking for.Sound is great, video is more than good enough but not full HD. However, the UI is so bad I am going to return it!My recommendation is if this can be upgraded to Android TV 9.x than its worth it, if you not and you are stuck with AppToid than I would say ""Do not buy!'",1,2021-01-21 00:00:00.000

"Kelsey Krenwinkel","Does not work well with Airplay for iPad","I bought this projector because I wanted to use it in my classroom to airplay from my iPad. I thought it was perfect because it was small, wireless (no cords!!!!!), and I could easily move it around my room. Once I got it and began using it, however, I realized that airplay from the projector to my iPad is very slow, sometimes unresponsive, and now won't even connect. The other issue is that it's really not very bright unless you have a very dark room. This is an issue for my classroom because my students still need enough light to write their notes. I had such high hopes for this projector. I will say that I liked the fact that it has the remote app (super convenient). The only thing I would recommend this projector for is to watch Netflix. Besides that, not worth it. I'm really underwhelmed, especially for the price.",2,2018-08-04 00:00:00.000

It's really easy to use and connect via HDMI or the app. It's compact size makes it easy to take with you, where ever you go, and the speaker is powerful enough that people in the room can hear everything they need to hear.BUT- the video quality is a bit dated at this point. Low ANSI Lumen number and non HD video playback makes this projector a relic of the past that has been bypassed by technology of newer items.Customer support was great to work with, and offered up a few great things to try and make this work better to fit my needs. Getting to be a beta tester and access the play store was HUGE....but it still left me wanting more from a video quality standpoint.Simply put- I don't think it's worth the price when compared to other similar projectors on the market in 2021.",2,2021-04-09 00:00:00.000

It's great that the hulu and Netflix apps let you pre download them if you decide to use this camping but i wanted to use my tablet considering i have over 200 movies and 7 tv shows on it. Also the projector doesn't come with the google play store even though it's powered by Android. They also have a bug when connecting your phone to it because it disconnects every 20 seconds or so. I decided to give the hdmi cable option a try but the sound is about a second behind so it's a little annoying.

"Pam","Disappointed and underwhelmed","I wanted to like it and keep it, I really did. I kept trying to convince myself that the picture quality wasn’t bad (it’s merely okay), that I wasn’t bothered by how poor the speaker is (it’s so bad), and I’m sad this was not the TV replacement I was hoping for.My apartment is pretty dark for most of the day compared to most places I’ve lived and it still wasn’t dark enough until night for the projector to show nicely. The speaker is honestly really terrible when compared with…anything else. I connected my UE Boom via Bluetooth in an attempt to solve that issue but the projector wasn’t smart enough to correct for the lag. The difference in audio quality between my external speaker and the projector was the final straw—the audio should not be a selling point.The app that you use to navigate the projector with is a little glitchy but I figured it out and navigation became a breeze, which I appreciated. I mounted it on a tripod and was impressed at how small the device is.I watched hours of shows hoping that I could get used to the giant pixels, audio, and lag. I wasn’t expecting top tier stuff, but I’d even prefer to watch things on an iPad compared to on the projector. It’s going back.",3,2021-06-23 00:00:00.000

You have to physically move the device. I really feel like I was sold something pretty. The wife uses it and likes it, but she has the same complaints as me. Too lazy to return this and it is functional at the very least. Maybe their more expensive models solve some of these problems? Try them first.",2,2020-09-02 00:00:00.000

It says you can stream from them and it was really hard to do so. I ended up just connecting my firestick and no sound came out The auto keystone is ok. But you’ll want to use the manual option because the auto is lacking. I don’t like it. It’s not worth the 300$ I’m still looking for a decent projector for less.",1,2019-10-12 00:00:00.000

But if you are looking for small, portable, good quality for an affordable price, then this should fit your needs. I’m in the military and deploy/TDY a lot. I couldn’t ask for a better versatile product. Not to mention when I’m home, the kids love using it. The sound quality is great, the resolution is better than I expected for such a small product.Update 6/17/2020: for some unknown reason the sound is now distorted when playing a video no matter what platform I use. When going through the different apps it seems fine. Makes the normal click sounds. Ran update and still doing it. Pretty bummed since I made sure to take care and store it properly.

However, when testing it for projection purposes at my kids' school, I found that connecting via my MacBook and iOS/Android, worked great.  I was not able to do Windows without using the HDMI connection. (I could have been doing something wrong but it certainly didn't ""just work"" like other operating systems)I then tried to use it during a school meeting and quickly realized the brightness just didn't work unless the room was completely dark.

Virtually everything about its functionality is awesome BUT because there is no way to amplify the audio any louder it can basically only be used indoors in a small room.

"Launie J.","Youtube sign in tip/trick","I was absolutely shocked at the top tier quality of this product. The fact that I can use this in a well lit room is mind blowing!One major issue though. The apps. Specifically YouTube. Upon initial attempts the app continues to crash and unfortunately this has been mentioned in prior reviews multiple times and it doesn’t appear as though Anker isn’t too vested in resolving this. Nonetheless I found a slight lifehack for this Nebula!“Watch on tv”If you’re signed into YouTube on your phone and you have a playlist you’d like to access or if you PAY for no commercials .. this is the simplest method of having YouTube recognize your account while projected.1. Go to settings (within YouTube) on the Nebula (you MAY have to select “more settings”)2. Scroll down to “Link with TV code”  2a. Once the code generates go to step 33. Open YouTube up in your mobile app and go to settings4. Select “watch on tv” it should then ask you to enter the code you will see projected via Nebula.Keep in mind this will only have specified videos you select on YouTube via your phone be played and recognized but not your entire YouTube profile.Option 2Signing in.This app crashes ALL the time when you hit “sign in” in the top right corner of YouTube. After many different techy methods I was able to get signed in. I’ll be honest I will provide steps to the best of my recollection (again I tried like 101 ways)1. Expand the navigation pane on the left side and scroll down to subscriptions or library2. Once the sign in option generates sign in .. now it should allow you to enter your username and password.3. The app will then crash lol now generally speaking I’ve the next few YouTube app launches it will sometimes recognized you as signed in already and other times it will not.THE BIGGEST THING TO HELP SECURE THE LOGIN IS TO WAIT ABOUT 3 MINS AFTER NEBULA LAUNCHES BEFORE YOU SELECT TO OPEN ANY APP ESPECIALLY YOUTUBE!I now give my nebula that 3 min window and each time I’ve launched YouTube it has signed me in! Ideally it’d be nice to have Anker not have customers paying $200-$300+ for a faulty app software BUT I guess we can’t expect too much. Would be 5 stars if we didn’t have to pay SO MUCH for an expensive SLIGHTLY faulty software.",3,2021-03-25 00:00:00.000

It's really small and portable2. You can install Netflix, Amazon Video and Youtube.3. You can mirror your smartphone or computer4. 4 hour battery life is pretty good5. I can connect to my bluetooth headphones, so I can watch it at night without disturbing my roommate.People said the noise from the projector is too loud. I don't find that an issue since the noise will be covered by the sound from your movie. I don't even notice the sound when I'm playing a show.In summary, if you're not too picky about the image quality, this projector is pretty good.

"Private125","Does the job, but was expecting more","I don't know, but for the money I spent on this unit was expecting more. My main complain is the sound is not loud enough. A group of 4-5 people need to be really quite and strain themselves to hear the movie or whatever is being projected. Keep in mind, that if you are outdoors, it may be impossible.Setting it up is relatively easy. But there doesn't seem to be way to beam from your phone. So, I suspect the apps on the unit will turn pretty stale in a couple of years - like they do on the (not so) smart TVs. And then, this unit will be obsolete.Otherwise, we have been using it in our backyard, so it does its job, I guess",2,

I've tried other no-name brand projectors that were less expensive and unfortunately they were brighter and clearer. This was a gift to my son, so he enjoys it and cannot tell the difference. But having tried others, I say the price is not worth it. And it is missing an audio jack for external speakers.

Sort of self defeating when it's the most useful purpose for such a device.... I dont get it, I pay for these services to watch them so I dont see what its protecting really, just disfunctional really.I also have to agree with some other people here as far as privacy that they are kind of being offensive to their customers with the violations.

At the price I would have expected it to last up to 3 years but looking online it’s pretty typical that it gives out about now. Unfortunately I didn’t know so I didn’t buy the extended warranty and am out of luck except to send it back and pay $139 to receive a refurbished one. There is also no known way to just replace the battery of the unit itself. I have purchased a lower price projector and will see how that stacks up. I hook it up to my Roku so I’m not doing to much, I will say when I tried to use the apps on this about every 10-15 minutes it would close out so I wouldn’t use that as a selling point.Remote - it stopped being useful a little over a year and changing the battery is a task, the manufacturer battery is lined to fit the shape so an off the shelf Duracell doesn’t fit properly.It is very portable and a cute product design.",3,2020-12-08 00:00:00.000

The image is quality is good for a projector its size.  It is a impressively designed product.I would be willing to live with the image quality if the sound worked.  I got rid of my TV and planned to use Capsule to project from my Apple TV.  Unfortunately, there was a noticeable lag between the image and the sound, could be bearable if it were not my primary viewing device.  Then Airplay does not work for popular apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO GO because of an issue with streaming copyright content.  The native apps within the Capsule work well but also have limited functionality; Amazon Prime only worked view browser.

"Ryan","Cool idea, great design, bad execution.","We debated keeping the device, it looked cool, solid, great design, picture quality was great but the interface was too sluggish and the version of Android OS was old and not very functional. For instance we couldn’t log into our Ytube account on the app. That was the deciding factor to return. Who wants to watch commercials? Also the bluetooth speaker needs some improvement.

"Isooda","Garbage.","I will be returning this tomorrow. It’s bad enough that it is too dim to watch outside at dusk, and that it is not HD quality. But what really seals the deal is having to ditch the remote that comes with it for a phone app in order to use Netflix or Amazon Prime. If that was not bad enough it does not actually give you access to the google play store. Major streaming services such as HBO Max are not available without emailing support and having to enter a unique password in order to get some of test build on the capsule.

I don't listen to movies loud because I have roommates but at regular sound that fan noise drives me crazy.New Update after having it for some time now.  I've lowered my rating to 1 star and I wish I could give it zero. All it's good for anymore is Netflix.  It doesnt work with my HULU or YOUTUBE, it doesnt do direct connect with mirror image.

Takes forever. cant scroll up and down to look at titles in apps such as Netflix. so you better know what to type in when looking for a movie. and everything has to be downloaded.

I bought this for my basement and even in the pitch black the image is pretty dim and grainy(and very low resolution!) and the speaker is pretty bad.

Not worth it.Returning it.",2,

When you read the instructions, it tells you NOT to put it on a rug!  The quality is okay...it definitely needs to be very dark, and the screen quality is meh.  Sound is okay, but not great.  The nice thing is that it's not super loud like normal projectors.  Because we won't be using it much and the quality was okay, we returned it.",2,2019-01-04 00:00:00.000

Outdated apps. Also, this is advertised as 200 ANSI lumen, but it’s probably really in 100 - maybe 140 if I’m being generous. And the fan sound is very loud.Worth the value for the quality?

"Meghan C. Hays","Really expensive for what it does...plus no way to fix a crooked projection.","I liked the convenience of this device, but I think it's pretty pricey for something that I have to use an HDMI cord and adapter to project Power Point presentations from my Macbook.  I really hoped it had a more ""streamlined"" (ie. wireless) ability to do this, but it appears there isn't.  It's cool that you can use it like a smart TV or Firestick with apps, etc., but that's not why I bought it.  ALSO the projection is crooked and there is NO way to fix this except to prop it up with some paper or a few tissues!  So frustrating!

The app allowing you to control the projector from your smartphone is also pretty cool, and the device is just sort of cool. Those are the pros.My problem with the Nebula Capsule is that the streaming options are disappointingly limited. All I want to do is stream my desktop, for example, and there is no way to do this wirelessly. I had thought there would be. Thus, my expectations were defeated. I had a vision for how I would be able to conduct presentations for customers, and now I have this HDMI trip wire tethered to my brand new laptop, constantly under foot and in the way.Additionally, the ""app store"" is loaded up with useless, third-rate garbage apps. Tons of garbage. Nothing I personally want to use. Sorry, I don't need Romanian soccer streaming, nor do I need a YouTube app that feels like Soviet bloc  YouTubeski.I'll make it work, and it will be fine for me.

Then within four months the speaker blew and now crackles. Without an audio output it has rendered the projector useless. I would have expected a bit better quality for the money. The remote is also awkward and for streaming, you must use an app on your phone to navigate. Not all apps are available through wifi.

I am quite satisfied as to how fast the pairing and setup went.  It is bright enough for most of my needs and of course small enough to take with me. I must say that up to the present I have been disappointed in the Youtube app.  I cannot ""sign in"" with my account apparently and thus cannot use my play lists. Therefore it becomes a burden to have to key in every video individually when I am trying to run a smooth program without stops.  Also the mirroring has been a real challenge with lag and breaking off between youtube videos.  I'm trying to rectify this by using the HDMI cable method and it works fine from my computer, but I am still looking for a toggle for my iPhone and iPad to accept HDMI.  Further, the device only plays a few kinds of video from my USB.  I'm still looking into android apps that will take and play the .mov, etc extensions.

I have two other Anker products and they are awesome. Unfortunately, for as great as the projector is - the audio is pretty bad. The sound is dull and tinny - no bass and no depth. So when you're watching a good movie or video, the sound quality doesn't match the functionality of the projector and it's a less than average speaker for audio only functions. I'm returning mine in hopes that the next version of the Capsule has better sound quality. That would make this one of the best portable projector/Bluetooth speaker combos on the market.

"Carsten Langrock","Useless for streaming (while using external bluetooth speaker) ... anything (sort of, see update)","Update II:I exchanged the unit in the hope that the new one would behave better with respect to simultaneous streaming and bluetooth connection to an external speaker. No dice, unfortunately. The problem still exists , sadly. This has nothing to do with the available wireless bandwidth as far as I can tell. The Capsule is connected to a 5GHz wireless-N network which provides 30-40 Mbps at the location of the machine; measured using speedtest.net on an iPhone 5S. Furthermore, the internal battery lasts about 2 hours, most definitely not 4 when playing video, and that's on the 'dim' screen setting. Funny enough, even when it is plugged into the wall, the battery keeps draining when watching a video and using the internal speaker. This was definitely unexpected and reminds me of old Android phones that weren't able to charge while using the GPS due to that component's current draw. You'd hope that a projector would run indefinitely when plugged in ... not so much. So, back to 3 stars.Update:I am adding a star (and a half, 3.5 starts total) based on customer service and the fact that I was able to isolate what looks like a firmware bug. The streaming (Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube) problems described below only occur when the box is connected to an external bluetooth speaker or headphone set; no problems using the HDMI port, or playing files from storage attached via USB. This is a bummer, of course, since bluettoth connectivity is able to sidestep the small speaker built into the unit. It's a 100% reproducible bug; I used an Anker Premium Stereo Speaker and Anker Soundbuds to test this, so all three being from the same company, there shouldn't be compatibility issues, you'd think. Let's see if Anker engineers can figure this one out. We do like the Nebula, so here's to hoping that this issue can be fixed.Original Review:Let me start with the good. The device is well made and feels very solid. Great packaging as well, for those who care;-) It is ultra portable, has an HDMI input, can mirror the screen of your iPhone (either via HDMI or AirPlay, the latter shows some lag, so no good for gaming), and plays video from a USB-connected storage device. Since it is based on Android and has built-in WiFi and Bluetooth, it can run applications, such as those used to stream video content either from a local server or the internet (Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, Plex). With its built-in rechargeable battery and speaker, it is really something I could see myself bringing on a trip. While the built-in speaker isn't anything to write home about, it will keep the kids happy enough; a nice feature is the ability to connect an external Bluetooth speaker or headphones (see firmware bug described in the update).Sadly, not all is well at this point.First thing after receiving the Nebula was installing Netflix, Amazon Video, Youtube, and Plex after upgrading to the latest firmware version. Despite the Nebula being placed in the same room as the WiFi router, which is connected via a high-speed cable modem to the internet, streaming failed within 60 seconds for all of the above-listed apps; I tried clearing the cache and also rebooted the device, no improvement. I imagine that this has something to do with the buffering algorithm. I even lowered the streaming quality within the Amazon Video app, and it still didn’t change the behavior.I should mention that streaming to a Roku, a FireTV Stick, iPads, and iPhones never results in buffer problems despite those devices being located nowhere near the WiFi router. I didn't find an option to manually enter a DNS address to see if that might help.Needless to say that one of the key features of the device is the ability to operate it in a portable / standalone fashion. If none of the streaming services work, not even streaming DVD-quality video (not HD) from a local server using Plex, what's the point?I reported the problem to Anker and hope to hear back from them shortly. We have several Bluetooth speakers from Anker which we are very happy with, and I have had a good customer service experience with Anker in the past, which was one of the reasons why I went with the Nebula. I am keeping my fingers crossed that this can be resolved since the product has a lot of potential.",3,

Not only is the fan making a loud clicking and spinning noise but the projector gets pretty warm to the touch.Also, I wish they went with a RF remote and not IR. Because it’s IR, and the receiver is on the rear, the remote needs to be pointed at the rear of the projector. I think it’s poor planning and a way to save a few cents. Note: They have an app to control it but I prefer a physical remote.Overall, if the noise wasn’t so bad, I think it would be pretty useful. However, with the loud clicking fan, it’s not a fun experience.",2,2018-05-24 00:00:00.000

"Adriana","Sadly dissappointed yet simultaneously awed","I would have loved to say that I'm happy with this product and that it is what I expected.....but I would be lying. I AM DISSAPPOINTED.  I received my capsule yesterday and was so excited with my new mini-home-theater that I invited my mother over to watch a movie. After tinkering with the Capsule for 3 hours, and NOT being able to watch any movie at all, I'm sadly writing this review. I bought this product because I was tired of watching movies on my computer, so I figured this would be a great option. The possibility of being able to mirror the screen of my computer seemed to be just what I needed. To my sad surprise, the mirroring is terrible. Not delayed-terrible, but mostly not-working-at-all-terrible.So if mirroring is not an alternative, I'm stuck with YouTube and Netflix and the other video apps that I'm not interested in.After a while of trying, we figured we'd just watch some stuff in YouTube. My only remaining option for unpayed content.Additionally to the POOR MIRRORING, the remote control works poorly or not at all. It got stuck, sometimes responsive, sometimes non-responsive. As other reviewers have said, the good thing is that the capsule app offers a much more effective controlling experience than the remote. So the problems of the defective/unoperative/limited remote seem to be solved if using the capsule control app.So now some pros: image was really good, sound ok. Not great but good considering the size of this soda-can shaped device.Beautifully designed, amazing little device for its size. So portability-wise it can't be better. I felt awe to see this tiny thing project such a good image.I understand it's a work in progress and that we're fortunate to have in the market a pico proyector that includes sound.I'm now facing the dilemma if to return it or not. With no mirroring, it's kind of useless for me.I'm not a tech person, so maybe there is an adaptor or cable that I can use to connect the capsule to my computer/iPad/phone and have the screen of my devices protected onto the wall. If this exists, I'll keep it. I loved the experience of a tv sized image (or bigger) anywhere in my home.However if such cable or adapter doesn't exist, I'll return the capsule and find a cheaper projector that can do the job of blowing up my computer screen onto a wall-sized image.Regardless of my seemingly negative review, I'm still amazed st the size and quality of the hardware. It is really picket-size.Thank you.",2,2018-02-10 00:00:00.000

"Gemma Davis","Screencast Not Compatible With Google Pixel Phones","I wanted to write and warn anyone who is thinking about purchasing this with a Google Pixel phone, the screencast does not work.The Nebula Capsule uses Miracast, which is not compatible with Pixels. I discovered this through my own research, as when I reached out to tech support I was met with the unhelpful response of asking if I followed the instructions for screencasting in the manual (which they then gave me the iOS instructions, despite the fact I specified I am using a Google Pixel with Android 8.1). When I told tech support that my own research shows that Miracast doesn't work with Pixels they confirmed that if you have a Google Pixel running Android 7 or higher, it will not work. I saw through my research that you can potentially get it to work if you root your phone and edit the build.prop, but just want to let people know before hand.I am very disappointed that the incompatibility is not disclosed anywhere, as a Google Pixel is a fairly mainstream phone. I was also disappointed with the lackluster help I received from tech support. I feel that Nebula should be more forthcoming with the compatibility of their devices and ensure this is disclosed in the description and specs.Compatibility issues aside, the unit is pretty great for the price point. Sound and picture are nice (the bluetooth functionality and Netflix still work, just screencasting that doesn't on a Pixel), so anyone with a compatible phone should be fine.",1,2018-03-13 00:00:00.000
"Andy","Nebula Capsule Review Updated!","My original review was based on receiving a used product.After speaking with Anker customer service I have to say that they went out of their way to try and resolve my issue, I wish all companies would work with their customers as well as Anker does.The product itself I only used for a very short time, and I will base my review on that.I loved the size of the unit, I was looking for something that could sit on a shelf when not in use and wouldn't take up a lot of space.While the lumens are not as high as some projectors, it was bright enough to see a clear picture in my darkened game room where it would have seen the majority of its use. The built in apps were an added bonus and I haven't seen other projectors with this extra functionality in this price range.Overall, if it was not for the unit having already been used I would have kept it and used it extensively.",3,2018-02-28 00:00:00.000
"Timothy","Not impressed - welcome to dongle life","I wanted to like the Nebula Capsule projector.  I really did ... the size and the speakers are delightful. To be fair, here is what I liked- small size- great sound (plenty loud enough)- able to install Amazon Prime Video and stream my movies over wifiHOWEVER, the Nebula Capsule has a number of issues that I can't stand.  For prospective buyers, you need to be aware of these problems:1. DIM PROJECTION --  If there is ANY ambient light, you will not be able to see the screen projected further than two feet. I can use it at night. Or in a bathroom with no windows. Or possibly camping under starlight. My kids can project onto a piece of paper a foot away.  At short range, the image looks great -- but what's the point when a tablet is the same size with better screen? I've used pico projectors years ago when they first came out, and expected the Nebula capsule to be brighter. It isn't.2. USB DONGLE LIFE -- I bought a 32gb (Fat32) USB flash drive to play back my movie collection. Unfortunately, the device ONLY has a micro-USB port so you have to use a dongle (included) to use USB flash drives.  Now my projector has a permanent rat's tail poking off the back. This looks dumb and you can't charge the device while using the USB dongle.3. REMOTE CONTROL REQUIRED -- This absolutely floored me.  I assumed I'd be able to control the device entirely with buttons on the projector.  Nope. You have to use the included remote control so you better not lose it. The capsule's amazing form factor becomes less impressive when you have to carry another accessory to make it work. The capsule phone app works pretty well but I'm not letting my kids have my phone just to pause their video.4. THE ROCKER BUTTON KIND OF SUCKS -- The device has four buttons on a rocker. Volume Up, Volume Down, Power, and Bluetooth speaker mode.  If my kids try to change volume -- or hold the device the wrong way -- the rocker activates the wrong button and the unit powers down or goes into bluetooth search mode.  The children then bring the projector back to me so I can find their video or use my remote to cancel the bluetooth error message. Poor design.5. CAN'T USE BUILT IN MEMORY -- I can't figure out how to do it.  I assumed the built-in file explorer would have a function for copying files off the USB and moving them into internal storage, but I can't find this function. I've never used android before, but I believe this is some kind of stripped down ""tv android.""  I tried plugging the projector into my clean Windows 10 PC and the Nebula doesn't show up as a storage device. What's the point of having all that memory if you can't put videos on it? For apps, I suppose.  I tried searching for online manual or PC drivers and can't find any manuals on on anker/nebula's website. The tiny printed manual is less than helpful. I guess I'm stuck watching videos off the dongle. I'm sure you techies have some weird workaround, but people shouldn't have to jump through hoops for this function.6. FIRMWARE  -- failed a few times. Finally downloaded completely, but the device wouldn't let me update until the battery was charged to over 50%.  It didn't matter that the device is plugged directly into the wall. This thing charges SLOW so I'm going to have to wait hours to install the firmware and see if it fixes any of these issues.  Update: it didn't.7. LOUD FAN -- I can live with this, but this is the loudest cooling fan I've ever had on a portable electronics device under five pounds. It almost sounds like white noise. Reminds me of the fan on my old 3000-lumen Epson projector - that device was 30 times brighter and used a halogen bulb, though.8. HARD TO ANGLE  -- the image is projected slightly upward and can't be aimed. The cylindrical shape and round footprint of the Nebula capsule make it hard to angle the device. If you slip a book under one edge, the capsule rolls over. The cube shaped projectors (like the Mars) are easier in this regard. You almost HAVE to get a tripod with this Nebula Capsule's round design.Summary - the Nebula capsule is a neat device, especially if it had come out years ago when the first pico projectors hit the scene. The form factor is cool and the sound is especially impressive for such a small gadget.  However, the projected screen is dim and the projector requires dongles and remote controls to use properly.The Mars seems like a better option as it is brighter (though only 500 ansi lumens), has a full-sized USB jack (no dongles), and most importantly has ALL the control buttons on top. I generally like Anker products (especially their battery packs) and wish the company much success.  However, I recommend passing on the Nebula Capsule. Mine is going back.",3,
"John Shi","Biggest problem is low brightness","This is a cool product - works well as advertised.  the BIGGEST problem, which made me give it a three star rating, is that, it is just not very bright.  Therefore, you will need to be in a very dark place to enjoy the projection.  The brightness is far below a regular projector, makes it useless in an office setting.",3,2018-01-15 00:00:00.000

"Ethan Vosburgh","An Under Baked Device","Yes, this is a projector the size of a soda can and that is impressive, but there are several major problems with it.1 - The limited Android app store is horrible. The only relevant apps I could use were Netflix and Youtube. This leaves a huge amount of entertainment apps out of the picture for me  (HBO Go, Amazon Prime, etc)2 - With the limited apps available you're reduced to having to use another device for content over HDMI.3 - The input lag on this thing is probably over 100ms making it a no go for any type of gaming.4 - They've already started on the Capsule 2 which means Anker is totally done trying to improve this product... They've already given up on it.Just don't buy this thing. It's a fun toy, but Anker really phoned it in and they really lost interest in this product quickly. Maybe in a few years with the Capsule 5 they'll get it right.",2,
"Alberto Gallegos","Really wanted to like it, but...","Where to start, had bought the red one they were having a “deal” on last week.  When I got it, felt nice and weighty. Very portable and sturdy. Issues came when I first plugged it in. Wouldn’t ever fully charge, in fact, it would try to charge but cycle on & off. When it did cycle on, the screen would light up for a couple of seconds and then turn off. I called Amazon and they tried to help but referred me to Ankers customer service #. I tried calling but since they’re in a different time zone were not available. For the price even on a “deal” wasn’t going to mess with it so I sent it back. Will say that for the moments the screen would come on, to have a great viewing you would have to be in a very dark room to get the best results. So I’m hoping they make a newer brighter version because this projector has great potential.",3,2019-03-26 00:00:00.000
"William B Partridge","Terrible software on pleasant hardware.","Hardware wise this little device is impressive.  It's not without it's shortcomings, notably brightness (100 lumens) and resolution (854x480), but they're common for the size and class of the device although there are some with higher resolution.  The size, battery life, and speaker volume and quality are outstanding though and generally make up for any shortcomings.  There are a few minor things to be aware of, the projector lens isn't centered so it can take a little fiddling to get ""straight"" figured out and it is tall, and thus top heavy, so tripod angles might be more limited than comparable projectors.Software wise this thing is a mess though.  AirPlay blocks most things with copyright protection (e.g. Netflix, Hulu, etc).  Android streaming is limited to Miracast only.  The included Android apps and those on the app store either don't work (e.g. Hulu won't play any actual videos), are limited (e.g. you can't sign into YouTube due to the lack of Google Play Services), or are frustrating to use (e.g. Netflix is there but buggy and frustrating to navigate).  Anker knows most of this it seems, in emails with support they've indicated they're working with Google on resolving access to Google Play Services and they've noted that AirPlay functionality is outside of their control, but it still means the device doesn't live up to its promises here.  As an additional note the included remote doesn't seem to work well or at all with most of the software.A big selling feature of this device is the software, that you can install apps on it and watch your content, but truth be told you can't or you can't easily at this point.  You're left with fine hardware, arguably great for the size, but the device doesn't live up to the marketing Anker provides.  If you don't care about the software, it's a great projector who's only real issue is that the resolution could be higher (e.g. 720).  But, to me at least, I bought this with the software in mind and it completely fails in that aspect for now.Pros:+++ Speaker is loud and clear++ Long battery life+ PortableCons:- On the lower end of resolution (480)- Remote doesn't work fully with a lot of software- Casting support is limited (Airplay blocks copyright material and Android is only Miracast)--- Software support is very poor (doesn't work, is limited, etc)",3,2018-01-22 00:00:00.000
"Alise Hernandez","Not compatible with Disney Plus and app is horrible","I received this as a gift and loved it until my app needed to be updated. The remote from my phone hardly works and often gets “stuck” (not just my phone, my husband’s too). Lastly, we signed up for Disney Plus and it’s not even downloadable on here! Get it together Nebula!!",2,2019-11-12 00:00:00.000

"Kathy Sue","Cool, just wish it were Brighter","I love the size of this thing, it's great!  And I don't mind keeping it plugged up when I'm binge watching, but I really wish it were brighter!  I knew the lumens were low but after being spoiled by a friend letting me use his larger over 1k lumens, it's been a rough adjustment. :/",3,2021-02-01 00:00:00.000
"AMY LOONEY","Chromecast","I connected them directly before making any final decision (considering the price) and they told me that a chromecast works fine with the Nebula. I re read the description and it says “does not work with chromecast”. I connected them again and they assured me it did. On a website stating the top 10 portable projectors it said it does not work with chromecast. I connected them again and showed them the proof. They said “unfortunately it does not work with chromecast”. I have screenshots of them assuring me it does. Lying company and almost spent $300 + an additional $30. Final answer, no it does not work with chromecast.",1,2020-07-27 00:00:00.000
"Lulu","Need help to run Netflix","I have tried on numerous occasions to look at Netflix, unfortunately the projector keeps going to sleep every 20 minutes and you have to keep pressing the power button and play button each time.

"NOSE","Over priced","Ankers products are great they are built to last and most importantly what separates them from their competitors is that they are ""dependable"" and fairly priced, but this nebula is is overpriced and I understand it was a project and probably has demanding funders but the should have set it at a lower price",2,
"Kindle Customer","Expect better for Anker Ruined my fathers day","this crappy thing is the opposite of user friendly.  don't say it works with IOS when it clearly does not.  want to try and work around that by trying to down load apps to the thing?  Good luck with that.  these android app stores are garbage also.  I was so excited to get this, and so disappointed when i tried use it.  Thanks for that Anker.",1,2019-06-16 00:00:00.000
"Hector A.","Disposable projector no repair centers in USA","Had received my capsule as a gift for about 8 months used it about maybe 40 hours of use and the projection went out.

"Jeffrey Z","Lack flexibility","As a projector it is solid. The picture is good and I can’t argue with that.  But it’s portability is very annoying.  I mainly bought it for that purpose and I intend it for outdoor. Camping and such.  However, phone projection is not optional unless it’s connected to the same Wi-Fi...... without Wi-Fi the remote control is the only option.  Even in my friends house, I can’t connect it to my phone because it’s not connected to the same Wi-Fi, and I can’t pair it to the same Wi-Fi without the remote controller ... idk. It’s not for me.",2,2020-07-10 00:00:00.000
"J. Goodwin","Two defective units right out of the box. Not good odds, skip this product.","It's neat, it works, the kids love movies outside. The user interface is clunky, and it's ridiculous they didn't add a micro sd slot, once you get past that it works for what it does, just could be a lot better.The trouble I have is, my micro usb slot is crooked, and makes inserting and removing the cable very difficult, and is scratching the heck out of the casing of the unit itself. I emailed anker, they, after sending pictures, CONFIRMED its it's a faulty unit, but since I purchased through Amazon's treasure truck sale, they have no record and insist I bought it 3rd party. Amazon refuses to send a simple replacement, stating I can return, and re purchase at the normal price ($120 more).So I have no choice but to purchase, or, rent another new unit, and send the faulty unit back for a full complete refund. I'm very disappointed in both companies in this refusal of very basic customer care.Update: Anker had reluctantly made an ""exception"" on my part to replace the defective unit. After receiving it, it does not connect to wifi, or rather, says it's connected, then displays connection error, on my home wifi, and 2 separate hotspots. So here we are, with 2 separate defective units out of the box. I have no recommendations at this time for anyone to purchase this product. I've fired off another email, I'll update or address this review with the results.",1,2019-09-01 00:00:00.000
